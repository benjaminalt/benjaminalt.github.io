I am interested in developing advanced cognitive architectures to solve real-world engineering problems with robots. As Technical Director of the [AICOR Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.uni-bremen.de/) at the University of Bremen, I work with a team of researchers, academic and industrial partners to bring about a future in which humans can intuitively program robots and ensure that their behavior is both task-oriented and safe.

Areas of interest:

* Robot self-learning
* Unsupervised and meta-learning
* Differentiable programming
* Mechanistic interpretability
* Safe embodied AI
