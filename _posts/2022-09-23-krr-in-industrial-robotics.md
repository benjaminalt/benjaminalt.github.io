A lecture I gave at the 2022 EASE Fall School in Bremen, Germany. The lecture covers important open problems in industrial robotics and motivates the use of knowledge-augmented learning methods to build self-learning robotic systems for industrial applications.

The lecture was given on Sep. 23, 2022 at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen, Germany.
