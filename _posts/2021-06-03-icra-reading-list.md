This is my personal post-ICRA 2021 reading list with papers I came across while attending the conference and which I particularly want to read. It is also intended as a resource for my colleagues who did not attend ICRA this year.

Most papers will be about task- or motion-level robot learning, but many intersect with other domains as well. If you presented a paper at ICRA you think I would like and it is not on this list, please <a href="mailto:benjamin.alt@uni-bremen.de">send me an email</a> and I promise to read it!

**Highlighted** are papers I read (or attended the presentation) and found especially insightful. This list is subject to change as I read my way through it or add more from the proceedings.
