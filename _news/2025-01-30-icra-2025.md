My team and I will present two papers at ICRA in Atlanta this year:

### Shadow Program Inversion with Differentiable Planning ([ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08678), [PDF](/assets/pdf/spi_dp.pdf))

Claudius Kienle, Darko Katic, Rainer Jäkel, Michael Beetz and I introduce a novel framework capable of jointly optimizing robot program parameters and motion trajectories. It introduces an N-DoF collision-free differentiable motion planner that is integrated into an end-to-end differentiable robot program representation, enabling first-order optimization of robot programs with respect to a wide variety of task objectives, such as cycle time minimization or proximity to a human demonstration.

The source code of our planner is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/benjaminalt/dgpmp2-nd).
 
Videos of the experiments and additional information are available on the [paper website](https://claudius-kienle.github.io/spi-dp-paper).

### QueryCAD: Grounded Question Answering for CAD Models ([ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08704), [PDF](/assets/pdf/querycad.pdf))

Claudius Kienle, Darko Katic, Rainer Jäkel and I introduce an LLM-based system for question answering and information retrieval on CAD data (CAD Q&A). QueryCAD enables users (or other LLMs) to ask questions about object geometries, part affordances and other engineering-related topics, and obtain answers that are grounded in CAD data. We also introduce SegCAD, an open-vocabulary tool for segmenting CAD objects given natural-language descriptions, as well as the first open-source benchmark for CAD Q&A.

The CAD Q&A benchmark is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/claudius-kienle/querycad/tree/main/benchmark)

Videos of the experiments and additional information are available on the [paper website](https://claudius-kienle.github.io/querycad).
