Our paper "Semi-Autonomous Robotic Assistance for Gallbladder Retraction in Surgery" ([<i class="fas fa-link"></i>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027660), [<i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i>](/assets/pdf/RAL_DKMP.pdf)) has been accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).

In this work, we introduce a semi-autonomous robotic assistance system for minimally invasive surgery that combines domain knowledge-informed feature extraction with neural and probabilistic modeling to improve both the effectiveness and interpretability of robot behavior during gallbladder retraction tasks.
