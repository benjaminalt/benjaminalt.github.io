This paper is dedicated to understanding the expressivity of reward as a way to capture tasks that we would want an agent to perform. We frame this study around three new abstract notions of "task" that might be desirable: (1) a set of acceptable behaviors, (2) a partial ordering over behaviors, or (3) a partial ordering over trajectories. Our main results prove that while reward can express many of these tasks, there exist instances of each task type that no Markov reward function can capture. We then provide a set of polynomial-time algorithms that construct a Markov reward function that allows an agent to optimize tasks of each of these three types, and correctly determine when no such reward function exists. We conclude with an empirical study that corroborates and illustrates our theoretical findings.},

A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises.

  abstract = {Recent developments in large-scale machine learning suggest that by scaling up data, model size and training time properly, one might observe that improvements in pre-training would transfer favorably to most downstream tasks. In this work we systematically study this phenomena and establish that, as we increase the upstream accuracy, performance of downstream tasks {\textbackslash}emph\{saturates\}. In particular, we investigate more than 4800 experiments on Vision Transformers, MLP-Mixers and ResNets with number of parameters ranging from ten million to ten billion, trained on the largest scale of available image data (JFT, ImageNet21K) and evaluated on more than 20 downstream image recognition tasks. We propose a model for downstream performance that reflects the saturation phenomena and captures the nonlinear relationship in performance of upstream and downstream tasks. Delving deeper to understand the reasons that give rise to these phenomena, we show that the observed saturation behavior is closely related to the way that representations evolve through the layers of the models. We showcase an even more extreme scenario where performance on upstream and downstream are at odds with each other. That is, in order to have a better downstream performance, we need to hurt upstream accuracy.},

In this study, we report the results from a systematic review of the state-of-the-art in home robotics research for caring for older adults. This review aims to address two questions: (1) What research is being done towards integrating robotics for caring for older adults? (2) What are the research and technology challenges that robots are facing in the home? Sixty-three papers have been identified and studied in this review by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Common themes that are consistent across the reviewed papers are distinguished and consolidated as follows: (1) Ambient assisted living, where smart home environments and physical support tools are studied; (2) Robot ecosystem, where robotic devices are used to provide various services; (3) Social interaction, where the social isolation problem has been targeted. We also summarize the results of similar literature reviews we came across during our search. The results of this study present the current research trends and technologies used in each category. The challenges and limitations of robotics applications are also identified. Suggestions for accelerating the deployment of robots at home for providing older adults with independent care in the home are presented based on the results and insights from this study.},

Pure position control is unsuitable for such tasks because even small errors in the desired trajectory can cause significant deviations from the desired forces and torques. The proposed algorithm takes a reference Cartesian trajectory and force/torque profile as input and adapts the movement so that the resulting forces and torques match the reference profiles. The learning algorithm is based on dynamic movement primitives and quaternion representation of orientation, which provide a mathematical machinery for efficient and stable adaptation. Experimentally we show that the robot's performance can be significantly improved within a few iteration steps, compensating for vision and other errors that might arise during the execution of the task. We also show that our methodology is suitable both for robots with admittance and for robots with impedance control.},

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.},

  abstract = {Deploying successful robotics applications requires tremendous effort due to the need for contributions of experts from various domains. We present the iserveU family of executable DSLs that separate the concerns of domain experts and robotics experts and leverage model-transformation at system run-time to enable the robotic platform to flexibly fulfill tasks in a changing real-world environment. Current research in DSLs for robotics applications focuses on abstraction in the solution domain, whereas our DSLs support the domain expert in declaratively describing properties of the domain and loosely coupled tasks. To enable flexible task execution based on the domain expert's declarative models, these are translated into components of a reference architecture prior to deployment and into planning domain definition language (PDDL) problems at system runtime. Resulting problems are translated into executable plans using the Metric-FF solver and re-translated into iserveU models that ultimately are executed against a loosely coupled robotics middleware. Leveraging model transformation at run-time enables the flexibility necessary for robotics applications deployed to dynamic environments where design-time assumptions and run-time reality diverge easily.},

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a specific form of learning from demonstration that attempts to estimate the reward function of a Markov decision process from examples provided by the teacher. The reward function is often considered the most succinct description of a task. In simple applications, the reward function may be known or easily derived from properties of the system and hard coded into the learning process. However, in complex applications, this may not be possible, and it may be easier to learn the reward function by observing the actions of the teacher. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the literature on IRL. This survey outlines the differences between IRL and two similar methods - apprenticeship learning and inverse optimal control. Further, this survey organizes the IRL literature based on the principal method, describes applications of IRL algorithms, and provides areas of future research.},

The method builds on ideas from classical regularisation theory and recent advances in deep learning to perform learning while making use of prior information about the inverse problem encoded in the forward operator, noise model and a regularising functional. The method results in a gradient-like iterative scheme, where the `gradient' component is learned using a convolutional network that includes the gradients of the data discrepancy and regulariser as input in each iteration. We present results of such a partially learned gradient scheme on a non-linear tomographic inversion problem with simulated data from both the Sheep-Logan phantom as well as a head CT. The outcome is compared against filtered backprojection and total variation reconstruction and the proposed method provides a 5.4 dB PSNR improvement over the total variation reconstruction while being significantly faster, giving reconstructions of pixel images in about 0.4 s using a single graphics processing unit (GPU).},

In the context of the manufacturing industry, where complex problems and decision-making processes are widespread, the XMANAI platform emerges as a solution to enable transparent and trustworthy collaboration between humans and machines. By leveraging advancements in XAI and catering the prompt collaboration between data scientists and domain experts, the platform enables the construction of interpretable AI models that offer high transparency without compromising performance. This paper introduces the approach to building the XMANAI platform and highlights its potential to resolve the ``transparency paradox'' of AI. The platform not only addresses technical challenges related to transparency but also caters to the specific needs of the manufacturing industry, including lifecycle management, security, and trusted sharing of AI assets. The paper provides an overview of the XMANAI platform main functionalities, addressing the challenges faced during the development and presenting the evaluation framework to measure the performance of the delivered XAI solutions. It also demonstrates the benefits of the XMANAI approach in achieving transparency in manufacturing decision-making, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and machines, improving operational efficiency, and optimizing business value.},

  abstract = {Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model's "hands and eyes," while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally-extended instructions, while value functions associated with these skills provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

  abstract = {Participating in a play is one of integral curriculum for young children at nurseries and kindergartens. At the same time, it is not very easy to successfully run and manage a play for young children due to their low age and immaturity. Scripts are difficult to memorize and children's attention span is quite short. We are exploring the use of a robot and augmented reality (AR) technology to assist the nursery teachers in hopes to alleviate the difficult and complicated task of running the play, and also as a way to increase the learning effect by promoting the concentration and immersion (by the presence of the robot and novelty of the augmented display) [1, 2, 3]. For this purpose, we have devised a semi-autonomous remote-controlled projector robot with the capabilities of background projection and control, generating the synthesized augmented view, camera/movement control, producing story narration and various special effects. We have recently deployed the robot assistant for a play ('Three Little Pigs') at an actual nursery to observe and investigate various aspects of human robot interaction. For instance, the robot interacts with the actors on stage, leading and guiding them by showing (with small display on the robot) the synthesized augmented view, script guidance, and putting forth and changing the backdrop projection. It also assumes the role of the "camera man" and may instigate minute interplay with the actor as it zooms in and out on actors (by remote control). Our initial observation indicated that the use of the robot and AR indeed exhibited very high potential in drawing the attention of the children and enhancing the educational effect, but required the right amount of autonomy and external control and an intuitive interface.}

Specifically, our Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) takes raw signals as inputs and extracts multimodal representations that are rich enough to benefit a variety of downstream tasks. We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and text-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT's vision Transformer achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1\% on Kinetics-400, 83.6\% on Kinetics-600, 72.7\% on Kinetics-700, and 41.1\% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training. Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to 64.7\% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images. VATT's audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event recognition by achieving the mAP of 39.4\% on AudioSet without any supervised pre-training.},

In this paper, we propose a novel LfD+RL framework, namely Adaptive Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (ACNMP), that allows efficient policy improvement in novel environments and effective skill transfer between different agents. This is achieved through exploiting the latent representation learned by the underlying Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model, and simultaneous training of the model with supervised learning (SL) for acquiring the demonstrated trajectories and via RL for new trajectory discovery. Through simulation experiments, we show that (i) ACNMP enables the system to extrapolate to situations where pure LfD fails; (ii) Simultaneous training of the system through SL and RL  preserves the shape of demonstrations while adapting to novel situations due to the shared representations used by both learners; (iii) ACNMP enables order-of-magnitude sample-efficient RL in extrapolation of reaching tasks compared to the existing approaches; (iv) ACNMPs can be used to implement skill transfer between robots having different morphology, with competitive learning speeds and importantly with less number of assumptions compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we show the real-world suitability of ACNMPs through real robot experiments that involve obstacle avoidance, pick and place and pouring actions.},

For this, the experience of the robot, which can be bootstrapped from demonstrated trajectories, is used to train a novel Neural Processes-based deep network that samples from its latent space and generates the required trajectories given desired rewards. Our framework can generate progressively improved trajectories by sampling them from high reward landscapes, increasing the reward gradually. Variational inference is used to create a stochastic latent space to sample varying trajectories in generating a population of trajectories given target rewards. We benefit from Evolutionary Strategies and propose a novel crossover operation, which is applied in the self-organized latent space of the individual policies, allowing blending of the individuals that might address different factors in the reward function. Using a number of tasks that require sequential reaching to multiple points or passing through gaps between objects, we showed that our method provides stable learning progress and significantly higher sample efficiency compared to a number of state-of-the-art robotic reinforcement learning methods. Finally, we show the real-world suitability of our method through real robot execution involving obstacle avoidance.},

We propose key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility, Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of our models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety of image and video tasks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to answer, captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an event, and close-ended tasks such as multiple-choice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art with few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples. On numerous benchmarks, Flamingo outperforms models fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.},

Most objects are made of multiple parts which are likely to be the entities actually involved in grasp affordances. Therefore, automatic object recognition and robot grasping should take advantage from 3D shape segmentation. This paper presents an approach toward planning robot grasps across similar objects by part correspondence. The novelty of the method lies in the topological decomposition of objects that enables high-level semantic grasp planning. In particular, given a 3D model of an object, the representation is initially segmented by computing its Reeb graph. Then, automatic object recognition and part annotation are performed by applying a shape retrieval algorithm. After the recognition phase, queries are accepted for planning grasps on individual parts of the object. Finally, a robot grasp planner is invoked for finding stable grasps on the selected part of the object. Grasps are evaluated according to a widely used quality measure. Experiments performed in a simulated environment on a reasonably large dataset show the potential of topological segmentation to highlight candidate parts suitable for grasping.},

The proposed method combines the benefits of programming by human demonstration for teaching appropriate grasps with those of automatic 3D shape segmentation for object recognition and semantic modeling. The work is motivated by important studies on human manipulation suggesting that when an object is perceived for grasping it is first parsed in its constituent parts. Following these findings we present a manipulation planning system capable of grasping objects by their parts which learns new tasks from human demonstration. The central advantage over previous approaches is the use of a topological method for shape segmentation enabling both object retrieval and part-based grasp planning according to the affordances of an object. Manipulation tasks are demonstrated in a virtual reality environment using a data glove. After the learning phase, each task is planned and executed in a robot environment that is able to generalize to similar, but previously unknown, objects.},

We present a simple action representation that supports this framework and describe a system that implements the framework on a two-armed mobile manipulator. We demonstrate the power of this system by evaluating it on a diverse task benchmark that involves manipulation of everyday objects. We then demonstrate that the system is easy to learn and use for novice users through a user study in which participants program a subset of the benchmark. We characterize the limitations of our system in task generalization and end-user interactions and present extensions that could address some of the limitations.},

  abstract = {The process of learning a manipulation task depends strongly on the action space used for exploration: posed in the incorrect action space, solving a task with reinforcement learning can be drastically inefficient. Additionally, similar tasks or instances of the same task family impose latent manifold constraints on the most effective action space: the task family can be best solved with actions in a manifold of the entire action space of the robot. Combining these insights we present LASER, a method to learn latent action spaces for efficient reinforcement learning. LASER factorizes the learning problem into two sub-problems, namely action space learning and policy learning in the new action space. It leverages data from similar manipulation task instances, either from an offline expert or online during policy learning, and learns from these trajectories a mapping from the original to a latent action space. LASER is trained as a variational encoder-decoder model to map raw actions into a disentangled latent action space while maintaining action reconstruction and latent space dynamic consistency. We evaluate LASER on two contact-rich robotic tasks in simulation, and analyze the benefit of policy learning in the generated latent action space. We show improved sample efficiency compared to the original action space from better alignment of the action space to the task space, as we observe with visualizations of the learned action space manifold.

  abstract = {In both industrial and service domains, a central benefit of the use of robots is their ability to quickly and reliably execute repetitive tasks. However, even relatively simple peg-in-hole tasks are typically subject to stochastic variations, requiring search motions to find relevant features such as holes. While search improves robustness, it comes at the cost of increased runtime: More exhaustive search will maximize the probability of successfully executing a given task, but will significantly delay any downstream tasks. This trade-off is typically resolved by human experts according to simple heuristics, which are rarely optimal. This paper introduces an automatic, data-driven and heuristic-free approach to optimize robot search strategies. By training a neural model of the search strategy on a large set of simulated stochastic environments, conditioning it on few real-world examples and inverting the model, we can infer search strategies which adapt to the time-variant characteristics of the underlying probability distributions, while requiring very few real-world measurements. We evaluate our approach on two different industrial robots in the context of spiral and probe search for THT electronics assembly.**See github.com/benjaminalt/dpse for code and data.},

This work presents a modular, hardware agnostic approach for programming robots to perform complex assistance functions in unstructured environments. We propose a robot-agnostic library of parameterized robot skills which encapsulate primitive tasks central to food preparation and serving, from which hierarchical manipulation sequences can be constructed. We further propose an approach for the automatic adaption of generated motions based on 3D point clouds of the environment to manipulate objects of different dimensions and shapes.

This is time-consuming and difficult for human programmers, particularly for force-controlled skills. To this end, we present Shadow Program Inversion (SPI), a novel approach to infer optimal skill parameters directly from data. SPI leverages unsupervised learning to train an auxiliary differentiable program representation ("shadow program") and realizes parameter inference via gradient-based model inversion. Our method enables the use of efficient first-order optimizers to infer optimal parameters for originally non-differentiable skills, including many skill variants currently used in production. SPI zero-shot generalizes across task objectives, meaning that shadow programs do not need to be retrained to infer parameters for different task variants. We evaluate our methods on three different robots and skill frameworks in industrial and household scenarios. Code and examples are available at https://innolab.artiminds.com/icra2021.},

We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

This provides one way of leveraging and combining the advantages of model-free and model-based approaches. Specifically, we differentiate through MPC by using the KKT conditions of the convex approximation at a fixed point of the controller. Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class. We show that our MPC policies are significantly more data-efficient than a generic neural network and that our method is superior to traditional system identification in a setting where the expert is unrealizable.}

Our approach decomposes questions into their linguistic substructures, and uses these structures to dynamically instantiate modular networks (with reusable components for recognizing dogs, classifying colors, etc.). The resulting compound networks are jointly trained. We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets for visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results on both the VQA natural image dataset and a new dataset of complex questions about abstract shapes.},

The training is performed in a simulated environment in which we randomize many of the physical properties of the system such as friction coefficients and an object's appearance. Our policies transfer to the physical robot despite being trained entirely in simulation. Our method does not rely on any human demonstrations, but many behaviors found in human manipulation emerge naturally, including finger gaiting, multi-finger coordination, and the controlled use of gravity. Our results were obtained using the same distributed RL system that was used to train OpenAI Five. We also include a video of our results: https://youtu.be/jwSbzNHGflM.},

In general, this is an ill-posed problem whose solution isn't unique. Inversion using iterative optimization method (for example gradient descent, quasi-Newton method) is useful to this problem and it is called "iterative inversion". We propose a new iterative inversion using a Bottleneck Neural Network with Hidden layer's input units (BNNH), which we design on the basis of Bottleneck Neural Network (BNN). Compressing input space by BNNH, we reduce the dimension of search space, or input space to be searched with iterative inversion. With reduction of the search space's dimension, performance about computation time and accuracy is expected to become better. In experiments, the proposed method is applied to some examples. These results show the effectivity of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {For many applications, in particular in natural science, the task is to determine hidden system parameters from a set of measurements. Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is well-defined, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: multiple parameter sets can result in the same measurement. To fully characterize this ambiguity, the full posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an observed measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task -- so-called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Unlike classical neural networks, which attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs focus on learning the forward process, using additional latent output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Due to invertibility, a model of the corresponding inverse process is learned implicitly. Given a specific measurement and the distribution of the latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides the full posterior over parameter space. We prove theoretically and verify experimentally, on artificial data and real-world problems from medicine and astrophysics, that INNs are a powerful analysis tool to find multi-modalities in parameter space, uncover parameter correlations, and identify unrecoverable parameters.},

However, most methods rely on pre-existing primitives (i.e. pick, open drawer) or similar examples of robot code alone, which heavily limits their scalability to new scenarios. We present PromptBook, a collection of different prompting paradigms to generate code for successfully executing new manipulation skills. We demonstrate example-based, instruction-based and chain-of-thought to write robot code; as well as a method to build the prompt leveraging LLMs and human feedback. We show PromptBook enables LLMs to write code for new low-level manipulation skills in a zero-shot manner: from picking diverse objects, opening/closing drawers, to whisking, and waving hello. We evaluate the new skills on a mobile manipulator with 83\% success rate at picking, 50-71\% at opening drawers and 100\% at closing them. Notably, the LLM is able to infer gripper orientation for grasping a drawer handle (z-axis aligned) vs. a top-down grasp (x-axis aligned).},

  abstract = {Today's manufacturing systems are becoming increasingly complex, dynamic, and connected. The factory operations face challenges of highly nonlinear and stochastic activity due to the countless uncertainties and interdependencies that exist. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), especially Machine Learning (ML) have shown great potential to transform the manufacturing domain through advanced analytics tools for processing the vast amounts of manufacturing data generated, known as Big Data. The focus of this paper is threefold: (1) review the state-of-the-art applications of AI to representative manufacturing problems, (2) provide a systematic view for analyzing data and process dependencies at multiple levels that AI must comprehend, and (3) identify challenges and opportunities to not only further leverage AI for manufacturing, but also influence the future development of AI to better meet the needs of manufacturing. To satisfy these objectives, the paper adopts the hierarchical organization widely practiced in manufacturing plants in examining the interdependencies from the overall system level to the more detailed granular level of incoming material process streams. In doing so, the paper considers a wide range of topics from throughput and quality, supervisory control in human--robotic collaboration, process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis, finally to advances in materials engineering to achieve desired material property in process modeling and control.}

However, the real-time streaming of such models introduces increasing challenges related to low cost, low-latency and scalable coding of the acquired information. In view of this, this article proposes an efficient scalable coding mechanism, that decomposes a mesh sequence into spatial and temporal layers that remove a single vertex at each layer. The removed vertices are predicted by performing Laplacian interpolation of the motion vectors. The artifacts that are introduced in low-resolution representations are mitigated using a subspace based normal-vector denoising procedure, that is optimized to support low-latency streaming scenarios using incremental SVD. A novel initialization strategy offers robustness to outliers generated due to local deformations. An extensive evaluation study using several synthetic and scanned dynamic 3D meshes highlights the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of both execution time and reconstruction quality even in very low throughput scenarios of bit-per-vertex-per-frame (bpvf).},

Current methods use either explicit or implicit causal reasoning, yet there is a strong need for a unified approach combining both to tackle a wide array of causal relationships more effectively. This research proposes a novel architecture called Context Aware Reasoning Enhancement with Counterfactual Analysis(CARE CA) framework to enhance causal reasoning and explainability. The proposed framework incorporates an explicit causal detection module with ConceptNet and counterfactual statements, as well as implicit causal detection through LLMs. Our framework goes one step further with a layer of counterfactual explanations to accentuate LLMs understanding of causality. The knowledge from ConceptNet enhances the performance of multiple causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery, causal identification and counterfactual reasoning. The counterfactual sentences add explicit knowledge of the not caused by scenarios. By combining these powerful modules, our model aims to provide a deeper understanding of causal relationships, enabling enhanced interpretability. Evaluation of benchmark datasets shows improved performance across all metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. We also introduce CausalNet, a new dataset accompanied by our code, to facilitate further research in this domain.},

It is organized in five main sections that cover increasing levels of autonomy. At level 0, where the bulk of commercial platforms are, the robot has no decision autonomy. At level 1, the robot can provide cognitive and physical assistance to the surgeon, while at level 2, it can autonomously perform a surgical task. Level 3 comes with conditional autonomy, enabling the robot to plan a task and update planning during execution. Finally, robots at level 4 can plan and execute a sequence of surgical tasks autonomously.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the Connectionist Inductive Learning and Logic Programming System (C-IL2P). C-IL2P is a new massively parallel computational model based on a feedforward Artificial Neural Network that integrates inductive learning from examples and background knowledge, with deductive learning from Logic Programming. Starting with the background knowledge represented by a propositional logic program, a translation algorithm is applied generating a neural network that can be trained with examples. The results obtained with this refined network can be explained by extracting a revised logic program from it. Moreover, the neural network computes the stable model of the logic program inserted in it as background knowledge, or learned with the examples, thus functioning as a parallel system for Logic Programming. We have successfully applied C-IL2P to two real-world problems of computational biology, specifically DNA sequence analyses. Comparisons with the results obtained by some of the main neural, symbolic, and hybrid inductive learning systems, using the same domain knowledge, show the effectiveness of C-IL2P.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing industry is in the midst of reshaping modern manufacturing by employing digital technologies due to its promising results. More and more companies are marching towards migrating their product offering and production infrastructure into Industry 4.0-compliant solutions. In this new era of industrial scenario, companies will need technicians and workers with digital skills mainly having abilities and competences in the Industry 4.0 Key Enabling Technologies (KET). However, lack of digital skills in the UK is considered perhaps the most serious obstacle to the practical implementation and investment in manufacturing digitalization technologies and is thus a major contributing factor to the UK productivity gap. Aiming to bridge the gap between the implementation of Industry 4.0 and educational organizations that focus on this field, the study presented here focuses on the development of a degree apprenticeship program in Digital technology solutions (DTS). The DTS program is developed in collaboration with leading UK industry partners to acquaint apprentices with appropriate knowledge that can help them to contribute towards digital transformation of their businesses.},

Furthermore, each algorithm is formulated in a high-level notation as an instance of the general, unifying basic algorithm, and the fundamental theoretical results on the algorithms are presented. Finally, after presenting experimental results for three test functions representing a unimodal and a multimodal case as well as a step function with discontinuities, similarities and differences of the algorithms are elaborated, and some hints to open research questions are sketched.}

The advantage of the implementation is to reduce the execution time while integrating advanced algorithms for autonomous manipulation. We describe our approach to 3-D perception, real-time planning, force compliant motions, and audio processing. Performance results for object grasping and complex manipulation tasks of in-house tests and of an independent evaluation team are presented.},

  abstract = {The current dominant paradigm in sensorimotor control, whether imitation or reinforcement learning, is to train policies directly in raw action spaces such as torque, joint angle, or end-effector position. This forces the agent to make decision at each point in training, and hence, limits the scalability to continuous, high-dimensional, and long-horizon tasks. In contrast, research in classical robotics has, for a long time, exploited dynamical systems as a policy representation to learn robot behaviors via demonstrations. These techniques, however, lack the flexibility and generalizability provided by deep learning or deep reinforcement learning and have remained under-explored in such settings. In this work, we begin to close this gap and embed dynamics structure into deep neural network-based policies by reparameterizing action spaces with differential equations. We propose Neural Dynamic Policies (NPDs) that make predictions in trajectory distribution space as opposed to prior policy learning methods where action represents the raw control space. The embedded structure allows us to perform end-to-end policy learning under both reinforcement and imitation learning setups. We show that NDPs achieve better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches on many robotic control tasks using both reward-based training and demonstrations.

  abstract = {The relational database is the way of maintaining, storing, and accessing structured data but in order to access the data in that database the queries need to be translated in the format of SQL queries. Using natural language rather than SQL has introduced the advancement of a new kind of handling strategy called Natural Language Interface to Database frameworks (NLIDB).~ NLIDB is a stage towards the turn of events of clever data set frameworks (IDBS) to upgrade the clients in performing adaptable questioning in data sets. A model that can deduce relational database queries from natural language. Advanced neural algorithms synthesize the end-to-end SQL to text relation which results in the accuracy of 80\% on the publicly available datasets. In this paper, we reviewed the existing framework and compared them based on the aggregation classifier, select column pointer, and the clause pointer. Furthermore, we discussed the role of semantic parsing and neural algorithm's contribution in predicting the aggregation, column pointer, and clause pointer.~ In particular, people with limited background knowledge are unable to access databases with ease. Using natural language interfaces for relational databases is the solution to make natural language to SQL queries.~ This paper presents a review of the existing framework to process natural language to SQL queries and we will also cover some of the speech to SQL model in discussion section, in order to understand their framework and to highlight the limitations in the existing models.},

  abstract = {We present two new types of neural networks (both of which can be trained with ordinary error backpropagation) and we present a new algorithm for learning a probability density function (pdf) from example vectors. It is normally difficult to invert a neural network, but for the new bijective neural network, it is efficient to find an input producing any desired output, and such an input is guaranteed to exist and to be unique. Furthermore, it can be used as one component in building a pdf neural network, which is a neural network with a nonnegative output, and for which it is guaranteed that the integral of the output is exactly 1.0 (as in a pdf function). Both of these can be used for supervised learning using standard error backpropagation. Finally, the new pdf learning algorithm is capable of using those networks to learn a pdf given i.i.d. samples drawn from that pdf, and to then generate new vectors from the learned pdf. This, in turn, allows inversion of a function with non-unique inverses, where each inverse is generated with just a single evaluation of the network.},

  abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) routes data based on their application-layer content names enabling location independence, in-network caching, and enhanced security. A proof-of-concept solution is presented that demonstrates the applicability of NDN for multi-user, multi-application, and multi-sensor data-fusion systems. The system consists of a collaborative network of weather radars name data based on their geographic location and weather feature (e.g., reflectivity of clouds and wind velocity). This enables end users to specify an area of interest for a particular weather feature while being oblivious to the placement of radars and associated computing facilities. Conversely, the data-fusion system can also use its knowledge about the underlying system to decide the best sensing and data processing strategies. Such sensor-independent names also enhance resilience, enable processing data close to the source, and benefit from NDN features such as in-network caching and duplicate query suppression, consequently reducing the bandwidth requirements of the entire data-fusion system. The solution is implemented as an overlaid NDN enabling the benefits of both the NDN and overlay networks. Simulation-based analysis using reflectivity data from an actual weather event showed 84\% reduction in peak bandwidth consumption of radars and 95\% reduction in peak query resolution latency.}

As such, robot architectures must rely on robust error recovery, adding non-trivial complexity to highly-complex robot systems. To handle this complexity in development, we introduce Recovery-Driven Development (RDD), an iterative task scripting process that facilitates rapid task and recovery development by leveraging hierarchical specification, separation of nominal task and recovery development, and situated testing. We validate our approach with our challenge-winning mobile manipulator software architecture developed using RDD for the FetchIt! Challenge at the IEEE 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation. We attribute the success of our system to the level of robustness achieved using RDD, and conclude with lessons learned for developing such systems.},

In various real-world settings, however, we might expect shifts to arise through the superposition of many small and random changes in the population and environment. Thus, we consider a class of random distribution shift models that capture arbitrary changes in the underlying covariate space, and dense, random shocks to the relationship between the covariates and the outcomes. In this setting, we characterize the benefits and drawbacks of several alternative prediction strategies: the standard approach that directly predicts the long-term outcomes of interest, the proxy approach that directly predicts shorter-term proxy outcomes, and a hybrid approach that utilizes both the long-term policy outcome and (shorter-term) proxy outcome(s). We show that the hybrid approach is robust to the strength of the distribution shift and the proxy relationship. We apply this method to datasets in two high-impact domains: asylum-seeker placement and early childhood education. In both settings, we find that the proposed approach results in substantially lower mean-squared error than current approaches.},

The research process starts with the customization of an application for smartphones, achieving a simple method of connection and attachment to the robot. This customization allows remote operation of the robot's movements and an additional level of autonomy for the displacements in previously known locations. One of several teleoperations methods is the direct teleoperations method, which is used in master--slave control mode via a wireless network. Next, the article focuses on proposing a validation methodology for social robot applications design. Under this approach, two tests are performed to validate the designed application. The first one seeks to find the response speed of the communication between the robot and the mobile device wherein 10 devices with different characteristics and capabilities are used. This test is critical since a delay outside the allowable range invalidates the use of the application. The second test measures the application's usability through a user survey, which allows for determining the preferences that people may have when using this type of application. This second test is essential to consider the overall acceptability of the social robot.},

  abstract = {Blood suction and irrigation are among the most critical support tasks in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS). Usually, suction/irrigation tools are controlled by a surgical assistant to maintain a clear view of the surgical field. Thus, the assistant's contribution to other emergency support tasks is limited. Similarly, when the surgical assistant is not available to perform the blood suction, the leading surgeon must take over this task, which in a complex surgical procedure can result in an unnecessary increment in the cognitive load. To alleviate this problem, we have developed a semi-autonomous robotic suction assistant, which was integrated with a Da Vinci Research Kit (DVRK). At the heart of the algorithm, there is an autonomous control based on a deep learning model to segment and identify the location of blood accumulations. This system provides automatic suction allowing the leading surgeon to focus exclusively on the main task through the control of key instruments of the robot. We conducted a user study to evaluate the user's workload demands and performance while doing a surgical task under two modalities: (1) autonomous suction action and (2) a surgeon-controlled-suction. Our results indicate that users working with the autonomous system completed the task 161 seconds faster than in the surgeon-controlled-suction modality. Furthermore, the autonomous modality led to a lower percentage of bleeding in the surgical field and workload demands on the users (p-value{$<$}0.05). These results show how leveraging state-of-the-art AI algorithms can reduce cognitive demands and enhance performance.},

The power of the planner derives both from the "good" properties of the potential function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape the local min ima of this function. The most powerful of these tech niques is a Monte Carlo technique that escapes local min ima by executing Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic use of distributed rep resentations (bitmaps) for the robot's work space and configuration space. We have experimented with the plan ner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects with 3 DOFs (in 2D work space) and 6 DOFs (in 3D work space) and manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOFs (in 2D and 3D work spaces).

We present a realistic, cluttered, VR environment for experimentation with household tasks paired with a semantic extraction and reasoning system able to utilize data collected in real-time and apply ontology-based reasoning to learn and classify activities performed in VR. The system performs continuous segmentation of the motions of users' hands and simultaneously classifies known actions while learning new ones on demand. The system then constructs a graph of all related activities in the environment through its observations, extracting the task space utilized by observed users during their performance. The action recognition and learning system was able to maintain a high degree of accuracy of around 92\% while dealing with a more complex and realistic environment compared to earlier work in both physical and virtual spaces.},

Using inaccurate models for learning can lead to sub-optimal solutions, that are unlikely to perform well in practice. In this work, we present a learning approach which iterates between model learning and data collection and leverages forward model prediction error for learning control. We show how using the controller's prediction as input to a forward model can create a differentiable connection between the controller and the model, allowing us to formulate a loss in the state space. This lets us include forward model prediction error during controller learning and we show that this creates a loss objective that significantly improves learning on different motor control tasks. We provide empirical and theoretical results that show the benefits of our method and present evaluations in simulation for learning control on a 7 DoF manipulator and an underactuated 12 DoF quadruped. We show that our approach successfully learns controllers for challenging motor control tasks involving contact switching.},

First-order methods exploit information on values and gradients/subgradients (but not Hessians) of the functions composing the model under consideration. With the increase in the number of applications that can be modeled as large or even huge-scale optimization problems, there has been a revived interest in using simple methods that require low iteration cost as well as low memory storage. The author has gathered, reorganized, and synthesized (in a unified manner) many results that are currently scattered throughout the literature, many of which cannot be typically found in optimization books. First-Order Methods in Optimization offers comprehensive study of first-order methods with the theoretical foundations; provides plentiful examples and illustrations; emphasizes rates of convergence and complexity analysis of the main first-order methods used to solve large-scale problems; and covers both variables and functional decomposition methods. Audience: This book is intended primarily for researchers and graduate students in mathematics, computer sciences, and electrical and other engineering departments. Readers with a background in advanced calculus and linear algebra, as well as prior knowledge in the fundamentals of optimization (some convex analysis, optimality conditions, and duality), will be best prepared for the material.},

Levels of robot autonomy (LORA), ranging from teleoperation to fully autonomous systems, influence the way in which humans and robots may interact with one another. Thus, there is a need to understand HRI by identifying variables that influence -- and are influenced by -- robot autonomy. Our overarching goal is to develop a framework for levels of robot autonomy in HRI. To reach this goal, the framework draws links between HRI and human-automation interaction, a field with a long history of studying and understanding human-related variables. The construct of autonomy is reviewed and redefined within the context of HRI. Additionally, the framework proposes a process for determining a robot's autonomy level, by categorizing autonomy along a 10-point taxonomy. The framework is intended to be treated as guidelines to determine autonomy, categorize the LORA along a qualitative taxonomy, and consider which HRI variables (e.g., acceptance, situation awareness, reliability) may be influenced by the LORA.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid robot cognitive architecture, CRAM, that enables robot agents to accomplish everyday manipulation tasks. It addresses five key challenges that arise when carrying out everyday activities. These include (i) the underdetermined nature of task specification, (ii) the generation of context-specific behavior, (iii) the ability to make decisions based on knowledge, experience, and prediction, (iv) the ability to reason at the levels of motions and sensor data, and (v) the ability to explain actions and the consequences of these actions. We explore the computational foundations of the CRAM cognitive model: the self-programmability entailed by physical symbol systems, the CRAM plan language, generalized action plans and implicit-to-explicit manipulation, generative models, digital twin knowledge representation \& reasoning, and narrative-enabled episodic memories. We describe the structure of the cognitive architecture and explain the process by which CRAM transforms generalized action plans into parameterized motion plans. It does this using knowledge and reasoning to identify the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of successfully accomplishing the action. We demonstrate the ability of a CRAM-controlled robot to carry out everyday activities in a kitchen environment. Finally, we consider future extensions that focus on achieving greater flexibility through transformational learning and metacognition.},

CRAM equips autonomous robots with lightweight reasoning mechanisms that can infer control decisions rather than requiring the decisions to be preprogrammed. This way CRAM-programmed autonomous robots are much more flexible, reliable, and general than control programs that lack such cognitive capabilities. CRAM does not require the whole domain to be stated explicitly in an abstract knowledge base. Rather, it grounds symbolic expressions in the knowledge representation into the perception and actuation routines and into the essential data structures of the control programs. In the accompanying video, we show complex mobile manipulation tasks performed by our household robot that were realized using the CRAM infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Simulation is increasingly being used for generating large labelled datasets in many machine learning problems. Recent methods have focused on adjusting simulator parameters with the goal of maximising accuracy on a validation task, usually relying on REINFORCE-like gradient estimators. However these approaches are very expensive as they treat the entire data generation, model training, and validation pipeline as a black-box and require multiple costly objective evaluations at each iteration. We propose an efficient alternative for optimal synthetic data generation, based on a novel differentiable approximation of the objective. This allows us to optimize the simulator, which may be non-differentiable, requiring only one objective evaluation at each iteration with a little overhead. We demonstrate on a state-of-the-art photorealistic renderer that the proposed method finds the optimal data distribution faster (up to 50{\texttimes}{\texttimes}{$<$}math{$><$}mo{$>\times<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$}), with significantly reduced training data generation and better accuracy on real-world test datasets than previous methods.},

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias--variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias--variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias--variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.}

However, responses that are unreliable, false, or invented are still a frequent issue.

Recent research has implemented Type 2 strategies (such as Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought), as strategies that mimic Type 2 reasoning, from Dual Process Theory, to interact with Large Language Models for improved results. The current paper reviews these strategies in light of the Predicting and Reflecting Framework for understanding Dual Process Theory and suggests what Psychology, drawing from research in executive functions, thinking disposition and creativity, can further contribute to possible implementations that address hallucination and reliability issues.},

This article tries to describe a framework in which many of the current methods and ideas can be placed and to provide a coherent picture of what the authors want to do, what have they got so far, and what the main missing pieces are. Generally speaking, the aim of symbolic control as is envisioned in this article is to enable the usage of methods of formal logic, languages, and automata theory for solving effectively complex planning problems for robots and teams of robots. The results presented in this article can be divided in two groups: top-down approaches, whereby formal logic tools are employed on rather abstract models of robots; and bottom up approaches, whose aim is to provide means by which such abstractions are possible and effective. The two ends do not quite tie as yet, and much work remains to be done in both directions to obtain generally applicable methods. However, the prospects of symbolic control of robots are definitely promising, and the challenging nature of problems to be solved warrants for the interest of a wide community of researchers},

The current approach to training them consists of maximizing the likelihood of each token in the sequence given the current (recurrent) state and the previous token. At inference, the unknown previous token is then replaced by a token generated by the model itself. This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence. We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead. Experiments on several sequence prediction tasks show that this approach yields significant improvements. Moreover, it was used successfully in our winning entry to the MSCOCO image captioning challenge, 2015.},

  abstract = {Selecting the right tuning parameters for algorithms is a pravelent problem in machine learning that can significantly affect the performance of algorithms. Data-efficient optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, have been used to automate this process. During experiments on real-world systems such as robotic platforms these methods can evaluate unsafe parameters that lead to safety-critical system failures and can destroy the system. Recently, a safe Bayesian optimization algorithm, called~SafeOpt, has been developed, which guarantees that the performance of the system never falls below a critical value; that is, safety is defined based on the performance function. However, coupling performance and safety is often not desirable in practice, since they are often opposing objectives. In this paper, we present a generalized algorithm that allows for multiple safety constraints separate from the objective. Given an initial set of safe parameters, the algorithm maximizes performance but only evaluates parameters that satisfy safety for all constraints with high probability. To this end, it carefully explores the parameter space by exploiting regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior. Moreover, we show how context variables can be used to safely transfer knowledge to new situations and tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of tuning parameters in experiments on a quadrotor vehicle.},

We show that MixMatch obtains state-of-the-art results by a large margin across many datasets and labeled data amounts. For example, on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels, we reduce error rate by a factor of 4 (from 38\% to 11\%) and by a factor of 2 on STL-10. We also demonstrate how MixMatch can help achieve a dramatically better accuracy-privacy trade-off for differential privacy.

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated many times that modern robotic platforms can generate competent bodily behavior comparable to the level of humans. However, the implementation of such behavior requires a lot of programming effort, and is often not feasible for the general case, i.e., regardless of the situational context in which the activity is performed. Furthermore, research and industry have an enormous need for intuitive robot programming. This is due to the high complexity of realizing an integrated robot control system, and adapting it to other robots, tasks and environments. The challenge is how a robot control program can be realized that can generate competent behavior depending on characteristics of the robot, the task it executes, and the environment where it operates. One way to approach this problem is to specialize the control program through the context-specific application of abstract knowledge.    In this work, it will be investigated how abstract knowledge, required for flexible and competent robot task execution, can be represented using a formal ontology. To this end, a domain ontology of robot activity context will be proposed. Using this ontology, robots can infer how tasks can be accomplished through movements and interactions with the environment, and how they can improvise to a certain extent to take advantage of action possibilities that objects provide in their environment. Accordingly, it will be shown that parts of the context-specific information required for flexible task execution can be derived from broadly applicable knowledge represented in an ontology. Furthermore, it will be shown that the domain vocabulary yields additional benefits for the representation of knowledge gained through experimentation and simulation. Such knowledge can be leveraged for learning, or be used to inspect the robot's behavior. The latter of which will be demonstrated in this work by means of a case study.},

Existing text-to-image models struggle to follow detailed image descriptions and often ignore words or confuse the meaning of prompts. We hypothesize that this issue stems from noisy and inaccurate image captions in the training dataset. We address this by training a bespoke image captioner and use it to recaption the training dataset. We then train several text-to-image models and find that training on these synthetic captions reliably improves prompt following ability. Finally, we use these findings to build DALL-E 3: a new text-to-image generation system, and benchmark its performance on an evaluation designed to measure prompt following, coherence, and aesthetics, finding that it compares favorably to competitors. We publish samples and code for these evaluations so that future research can continue optimizing this important aspect of text-to-image systems.},

  abstract = {Robotic systems are ever more capable of automation and fulfilment of complex tasks, particularly with reliance on recent advances in intelligent systems, deep learning and artificial intelligence in general. However, as robots and humans come closer together in their interactions, the matter of interpretability, or explainability of robot decision-making processes for the human grows in importance. A successful interaction and collaboration would only be possible through mutual understanding of underlying representations of the environment and the task at hand. This is currently a challenge in deep learning systems. We present a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning system, consisting of a low-level agent handling the large actions/states space of a robotic system efficiently, by following the directives of a high-level agent which is learning the high-level dynamics of the environment and task. This high-level agent forms a representation of the world and task at hand that is interpretable for a human operator. The method, which we call Dot-to-Dot, is tested on a MuJoCo-based model of the Fetch Robotics Manipulator, as well as a Shadow Hand, to test its performance. Results show efficient learning of complex actions/states spaces by the low-level agent, and an interpretable representation of the task and decision-making process learned by the high-level agent.},

However, trajectory optimization algorithms have parameters that are typically set in advance (and rarely discussed in detail). Setting these parameters properly can have a significant impact on the practical performance of the algorithm, sometimes making the difference between finding a feasible plan or failing at the task entirely. We propose a method for leveraging past experience to learn how to automatically adapt the parameters of Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP) algorithms. Specifically, we propose a differentiable extension to the GPMP2 algorithm, so that it can be trained end-to-end from data. We perform several experiments that validate our algorithm and illustrate the benefits of our proposed learning-based approach to motion planning.},

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons, can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensional image. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory.

This paper reviews the current state of the art in robot programming systems. A distinction is made between manual and automatic programming systems. Manual systems require the user/programmer to create the robot program directly, by hand, while automatic systems generate a robot program as a result of interaction between the robot and the human; there are a variety of methods including learning, programming by demonstration and instructive systems.}

This immediately eliminates the need for expensive numerical solvers while still maintaining the modeling capability of neural ODEs. We propose several flow architectures suitable for different applications by establishing precise conditions on when a function defines a valid flow. Apart from computational efficiency, we also provide empirical evidence of favorable generalization performance via applications in time series modeling, forecasting, and density estimation.},

Building upon this taxonomy, we selected three representative tasks from the taxonomy to evaluate in a virtual reality simulation. We conducted a series of human subject experiments to compare user performance and preference on a disassembly task with and without haptic feedback using CyberGlove, Phantom, and SpaceMouse interfaces. Analysis of the simulation runs shows Phantom users learned to accomplish the simulated actions significantly more quickly than did users of the CyberGlove or the SpaceMouse. Moreover, a lack of differences in the post-experiment questionnaire suggests that haptics research should include a measure of actual performance speed or accuracy rather than relying solely on subjective reports of a device's ease of use.},

It regularises the weights by minimising a compression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Robots need models of human behavior for both inferring human goals and preferences, and predicting what people will do. A common model is the Boltzmann noisily-rational decision model, which assumes people approximately optimize a reward function and choose trajectories in proportion to their exponentiated reward. While this model has been successful in a variety of robotics domains, its roots lie in econometrics, and in modeling decisions among different discrete options, each with its own utility or reward. In contrast, human trajectories lie in a continuous space, with continuous-valued features that influence the reward function. We propose that it is time to rethink the Boltzmann model, and design it from the ground up to operate over such trajectory spaces. We introduce a model that explicitly accounts for distances between trajectories, rather than only their rewards. Rather than each trajectory affecting the decision independently, similar trajectories now affect the decision together. We start by showing that our model better explains human behavior in a user study. We then analyze the implications this has for robot inference, first in toy environments where we have ground truth and find more accurate inference, and finally for a 7DOF robot arm learning from user demonstrations.},

Although current advances are expected to impact surgery, up until now AI has not been able to leverage its full potential due to several challenges that are specific to that field. Summary This review summarizes data-driven methods and technologies needed as a prerequisite for different AI-based assistance functions in the operating room. Potential effects of AI usage in surgery will be highlighted, concluding with ongoing challenges to enabling AI for surgery. Key Messages AI-assisted surgery will enable data-driven decision-making via decision support systems and cognitive robotic assistance. The use of AI for workflow analysis will help provide appropriate assistance in the right context. The requirements for such assistance must be defined by surgeons in close cooperation with computer scientists and engineers. Once the existing challenges will have been solved, AI assistance has the potential to improve patient care by supporting the surgeon without replacing him or her.},

In this paper, we present a system for generating personalized explanations of robot path planning via user feedback. We consider a robot navigating in an environment modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop an algorithm to automatically generate a personalized explanation of an optimal MDP policy, based on the user preference regarding four elements (i.e., objective, locality, specificity, and corpus). In addition, we design the system to interact with users via answering users' further questions about the generated explanations. Users have the option to update their preferences to view different explanations. The system is capable of detecting and resolving any preference conflict via user interaction. The results of an online user study show that the generated personalized explanations improve user satisfaction, while the majority of users liked the system's capabilities of question-answering and conflict detection/resolution.},

  abstract = {Automatic parameter tuning of parallel codes is ubiquitous in today's HPC environments where the performance portability of said codes is expected to keep pace with the perpetual release of new hardware. With changes in hardware, it is often the case that finding an optimal configuration of these codes is challenging and only further complicated by the high dimensionality or discontinuous topologies of the tuning spaces. Selecting a proper optimization strategy to automatically search these spaces is paramount to minimizing the energy and time spent on exploring sub-optimal configurations. Unfortunately, it is often the case that these optimizers have hyperparameters of their own, which are sensitive and can greatly affect the outcome of quickly converging to, or even finding an optimal code configuration. Much of the existing autotuning literature tends to use particular optimizers without describing their hyperparameter selection, leaving readers to figure out how to configure their optimizer for the best performance. In this work we compare and contrast the popular global optimization strategy of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to two less popular strategies: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Covariance Matrix Adaptive Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). We sweep the hyperparameters of these three optimizers in the context of tuning OpenMP hyperparameters of four classic OpenMP programs: BT, FT, HPCG, and Lulesh. Our study compares the long-term search behavior and average time-to-convergence between these three optimization strategies in tuning OpenMP codes. We contribute a detailed study of these strategies and provide deeper insights as to their sensitivities, noting the conditions where each performs well, and hinting at which optimizers require minimal tuning of their hyperparameters for desirable tuning results.},

  abstract = {Robotics has long been a field riddled with complex systems architectures whose modules and connections, whether traditional or learning-based, require significant human expertise and prior knowledge. Inspired by large pre-trained language models, this work introduces a paradigm for pre-training a general purpose representation that can serve as a starting point for multiple tasks on a given robot. We present the Perception-Action Causal Transformer (PACT), a generative transformer-based architecture that aims to build representations directly from robot data in a self-supervised fashion. Through autoregressive prediction of states and actions over time, our model implicitly encodes dynamics and behaviors for a particular robot. Our experimental evaluation focuses on the domain of mobile agents, where we show that this robot-specific representation can function as a single starting point to achieve distinct tasks such as safe navigation, localization and mapping. We evaluate two form factors: a wheeled robot that uses a LiDAR sensor as perception input (MuSHR), and a simulated agent that uses first-person RGB images (Habitat). We show that finetuning small task-specific networks on top of the larger pretrained model results in significantly better performance compared to training a single model from scratch for all tasks simultaneously, and comparable performance to training a separate large model for each task independently. By sharing a common good-quality representation across tasks we can lower overall model capacity and speed up the real-time deployment of such systems.},

Short-term impacts of increased openness appear mostly socially beneficial in expectation. The strategic implications of medium and long-term impacts are complex. The evaluation of long-term impacts, in particular, may depend on whether the objective is to benefit the present generation or to promote a time-neutral aggregate of well-being of future generations. Some forms of openness are plausibly positive on both counts (openness about safety measures, openness about goals). Others (openness about source code, science, and possibly capability) could lead to a tightening of the competitive situation around the time of the introduction of advanced AI, increasing the probability that winning the AI race is incompatible with using any safety method that incurs a delay or limits performance. We identify several key factors that must be taken into account by any well-founded opinion on the matter.},

Inspired by recent advances in foundation models for vision and language, we propose a multi-embodiment, multi-task generalist agent for robotic manipulation. This agent, named RoboCat, is a visual goal-conditioned decision transformer capable of consuming action-labelled visual experience. This data spans a large repertoire of motor control skills from simulated and real robotic arms with varying sets of observations and actions. With RoboCat, we demonstrate the ability to generalise to new tasks and robots, both zero-shot as well as through adaptation using only 100--1000 examples for the target task. We also show how a trained model itself can be used to generate data for subsequent training iterations, thus providing a basic building block for an autonomous improvement loop. We investigate the agent's capabilities, with large-scale evaluations both in simulation and on three different real robot embodiments. We find that as we grow and diversify its training data, RoboCat not only shows signs of cross-task transfer, but also becomes more efficient at adapting to new tasks.},

An appealing alternative is to use off-the-shelf simulators to render synthetic data for which ground-truth annotations are generated automatically. Unfortunately, models trained purely on simulated data often fail to generalize to the real world. We study how randomized simulated environments and domain adaptation methods can be extended to train a grasping system to grasp novel objects from raw monocular RGB images. We extensively evaluate our approaches with a total of more than 25,000 physical test grasps, studying a range of simulation conditions and domain adaptation methods, including a novel extension of pixel-level domain adaptation that we term the GraspGAN. We show that, by using synthetic data and domain adaptation, we are able to reduce the number of real-world samples needed to achieve a given level of performance by up to 50 times, using only randomly generated simulated objects. We also show that by using only unlabeled real-world data and our GraspGAN methodology, we obtain real-world grasping performance without any real-world labels that is similar to that achieved with 939,777 labeled real-world samples.},

  abstract = {Instrumenting and collecting annotated visual grasping datasets to train modern machine learning algorithms can be extremely time-consuming and expensive. An appealing alternative is to use off-the-shelf simulators to render synthetic data for which ground-truth annotations are generated automatically. Unfortunately, models trained purely on simulated data often fail to generalize to the real world. We study how randomized simulated environments and domain adaptation methods can be extended to train a grasping system to grasp novel objects from raw monocular RGB images. We extensively evaluate our approaches with a total of more than 25,000 physical test grasps, studying a range of simulation conditions and domain adaptation methods, including a novel extension of pixel-level domain adaptation that we term the GraspGAN. We show that, by using synthetic data and domain adaptation, we are able to reduce the number of real-world samples needed to achieve a given level of performance by up to 50 times, using only randomly generated simulated objects. We also show that by using only unlabeled real-world data and our GraspGAN methodology, we obtain real-world grasping performance without any real-world labels that is similar to that achieved with 939,777 labeled real-world samples.},

Furthermore, we show how non-smooth penalty functions can be incorporated into our framework to handle state constraints.

Yet, such explanations may provide too much information, generating potential confusion for the end-users with no specific knowledge, neither on the machine learning, nor on the application domains. In this paper, we investigate the design of explanation user interfaces for plural counterfactual examples offering comparative analysis features to mitigate this potential confusion and improve the intelligibility of such explanations for non-expert users. We propose an implementation of such an enhanced explanation user interface, illustrating it in a financial scenario related to a loan application. We then present the results of a lab user study conducted with 112 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of having plural examples and of offering comparative analysis principles, both on the objective understanding and satisfaction of such explanations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the plural condition, both on objective understanding and satisfaction scores, as compared to having a single counterfactual example. Beside the statistical analysis, we perform a thematic analysis of the participants' responses to the open-response questions, that also shows encouraging results for the comparative analysis features on the objective understanding.},

  abstract = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas--Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for {$\ell$}1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations.}

However, such a simulation technique is usually computationally-expensive and may not be achieved with agents' self computing power. For this problem, cloud robotics may offer a solution. Cloud robotics is an emerging field in the intersection of robotics and cloud computing which enables robots to access a greater amount of processing power and storage capacity than it can employ within itself. In this work, we introduce a mental simulation service to, one of the cloud engines, openEASE [1]. Using this service, researchers and robots can describe the world model, the state of the agent and the problem that is being dealt with. In return, it simulates the world and runs a learning algorithm and suggests a solution how the robotic agent can handle the problem. This service does not only offer a free remote access to simulation which is computationally expensive but also thanks to OPEnEASE's rich reasoning techniques these simulated experiments can be reasoned later on using prolog queries.},

  abstract = {Knowledge representation is at the very core of a radical idea for understanding intelligence. Instead of trying to understand or build brains from the bottom up, its goal is to understand and build intelligent behavior from the top down, putting the focus on what an agent needs to know in order to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be represented symbolically, and how automated reasoning procedures can make this knowledge available as needed. This landmark text takes the central concepts of knowledge representation developed over the last 50 years and illustrates them in a lucid and compelling way. Each of the various styles of representation is presented in a simple and intuitive form, and the basics of reasoning with that representation are explained in detail. This approach gives readers a solid foundation for understanding the more advanced work found in the research literature. The presentation is clear enough to be accessible to a broad audience, including researchers and practitioners in database management, information retrieval, and object-oriented systems as well as artificial intelligence. This book provides the foundation in knowledge representation and reasoning that every AI practitioner needs.},

More relevant (but less group theoretic) is the extensive case-by-case analysis found in Pieper's thesis [9]. In fact, Pieper's work suggests an interesting and rather general problem in Galois theory which is directly related to manipulation. Also of interest is the well-known Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for the derivative of a product of exponentials since such products are of fundamental importance in the study of kinematic programming.},

Even simple operations in this domain require complex interaction between multiple robots and the number of contingencies that must be addressed if the team is to act completely autonomously is prohibitively large. This scenario forces incorporation of a human operator. Ideally we would like a seamless interface between the robots and the operator such that the operator can interact with the system by helping it be more efficient or get out of a stuck condition or performing a task that the robots are not capable of themselves. We use an architecture that implements "sliding autonomy" to accomplish these goals. The system of robots can be fully autonomous as long as all is well. The system is capable of accepting input from the operator at any time, especially when it is unable to recover from a failure. We motivate this scenario with results from an extended series of experiments we have conducted with three robots that work together to dock both ends of a suspended beam. We show the difference in performance between a completely teleoperated system, a fully autonomous system, and one in which sliding autonomy has been incorporated.},

  abstract = {Industrial software often has many parameters that critically impact performance. Frequently, these are left in a sub-optimal configuration for a given application because searching over possible configurations is costly and, except for developer instinct, the relationships between parameters and performance are often unclear and complex. While there have been significant advances in automated parameter tuning approaches recently, they are typically black-box. The high-quality solutions produced are returned to the user without explanation. The nature of optimisation means that, often, these solutions are far outside the well-established settings for the software, making it difficult to accept and use them. To address the above issue, a systematic approach to software parameter optimization is presented. Several well-established techniques are followed in sequence, each underpinning the next, with rigorous analysis of the search space. This allows the results to be explainable to both end users and developers, improving confidence in the optimal solutions, particularly where they are counter-intuitive. The process comprises statistical analysis of the parameters; single-objective optimization for each target objective; functional ANOVA to explain trends and inter-parameter interactions; and a multi-objective optimization seeded with the results from the single-objective stage. A case study demonstrates application to business-critical software developed by the international airline Air France-KLM for measuring flight schedule robustness. A configuration is found with a run-time of 80\% that of the tried-and-tested configuration, with no loss in predictive accuracy. The configuration is supplemented with detailed analysis explaining the importance of each parameter, how they interact with each other, how they influence run-time and accuracy, and how the final configuration was reached. In particular, this explains why the configuration included some parameter settings that were outwith the usually recommended range, greatly increasing developer confidence and encouraging adoption of the new configuration.},

Although they share similar requirements and market segments, their implementations and ecosystems differ considerably. As a result, end customers and device manufacturers are faced with a multitude of technologies that need to be produced, run, diagnosed, maintained, and kept in stock. Although the availability of products and services is largely satisfactory, dealing with multiple solutions generates high costs and limits IoT capability. This paper introduces Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture Time-Sensitive Networking (OPC UA TSN) as a new technology and presents the current view. This time, the industrial prospects of fulfilling industrial communication requirements while leveraging the cost benefits of standard Ethernet hardware in the midterm are in reach.

  abstract = {Autonomous robot tasks involving contacts with the environment must be performed under active force control if the geometric uncertainties in the task models are too large to cope with by means of passive compliance only. In practice, task specification of force-controlled actions is closely linked to the task frame formalism (TFF), also known as the compliance frame formalism. The TFF is a very intuitive and controller-independent approach to model a motion constraint, and to specify the desired forces and motions compatible with this constraint. However, it has never been defined clearly and unambiguously, and it cannot cope with all possible constrained motion tasks. This paper provides, for the first time, a formal definition of what makes up a TFF task specification. It gives also a synthesis of which tasks the TFF can cope with, and proposes a generic textual task specification formalism. Finally, it describes an example constrained motion task that the TFF cannot handle.},

Eleven therapists with a mean age of 39 years working in the care for persons with visual-and-intellectual disabilities participated. The results show good usability of the interface, as measured via the CDN framework and the cyclomatic complexity analysis showed an increased complexity of the created by the occupational and rehabilitation therapist's scenarios.

  abstract = {In the efficient global optimization problem, we minimize an unknown function f, using as few observations f(x) as possible. It can be considered a continuum-armed-bandit problem, with noiseless data, and simple regret. Expected-improvement algorithms are perhaps the most popular methods for solving the problem; in this paper, we provide theoretical results on their asymptotic behaviour. Implementing these algorithms requires a choice of Gaussian-process prior, which determines an associated space of functions, its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is fixed, expected improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in its RKHS. We provide convergence rates for this procedure, optimal for functions of low smoothness, and describe a modified algorithm attaining optimal rates for smoother functions. In practice, however, priors are typically estimated sequentially from the data. For standard estimators, we show this procedure may never find the minimum of f. We then propose alternative estimators, chosen to minimize the constants in the rate of convergence, and show these estimators retain the convergence rates of a fixed prior.}

An overview of previous work is first provided along with an analysis of the tradeoffs between arm and hand dexterity. A hand-centric and motion-centric manipulation classification is then presented and applied in four different ways. It is first discussed how the taxonomy can be used to identify a manipulation strategy. Then, applications for robot hand analysis and engineering design are explained. Finally, the classification is applied to three activities of daily living (ADLs) to distinguish the patterns of dexterous manipulation involved in each task. The same analysis method could be used to predict problem ADLs for various impairments or to produce a representative benchmark set of ADL tasks. Overall, the classification scheme proposed creates a descriptive framework that can be used to effectively describe hand movements during manipulation in a variety of contexts and might be combined with existing object centric or other taxonomies to provide a complete description of a specific manipulation task.}

  abstract = {We propose a biologically realistic neural network that computes coordinate transformations for the command of arm reaching movements in 3-D space. This model is consistent with anatomical and physiological data on the cortical areas involved in the command of these movements. Studies of the neuronal activity in the motor (Georgopoulos et al., 1986; Schwartz et al., 1988; Caminiti et al., 1990a) and premotor (Caminiti et al., 1990b, 1991) cortices of behaving monkeys have shown that the activity of individual arm-related neurons is broadly tuned around a preferred direction of movements in 3-D space. Recent data demonstrate that in both frontal areas (Caminiti et al., 1990a,b, 1991) these cell preferred directions rotate with the initial position of the arm. Furthermore, the rotation of the population of preferred directions precisely corresponds to the rotation of the arm in space. The neural network model computes the motor command by combining the visual information about movement trajectory with the kinesthetic information concerning the orientation of the arm in space. The appropriate combination, learned by the network from spontaneous movement, can be approximated by a bilinear operation that can be interpreted as a projection of the visual information on a reference frame that rotates with the arm. This bilinear combination implies that neural circuits converging on a single neuron in the motor and premotor cortices can learn and generalize the appropriate command in a 2-D subspace but not in the whole 3-D space. However, the uniform distribution of cell preferred directions in these frontal areas can explain the computation of the correct solution by a population of cortical neurons. The model is consistent with the existing neurophysiological data and predicts how visual and somatic information can be combined in the different processing steps of the visuomotor transformation subserving visual reaching.},

In this paper, we identify three types of questions (label, demonstration and feature queries) and discuss how a robot can use these while learning new skills. Then, we present an experiment on human question asking which characterizes the extent to which humans use these question types. Finally, we evaluate the three question types within a human-robot teaching interaction. We investigate the ease with which different types of questions are answered and whether or not there is a general preference of one type of question over another. Based on our findings from both experiments we provide guidelines for designing question asking behaviors on a robot learner.},

Recently, state of the art algorithms providing a better understanding of the surroundings (Object detection, skeleton tracking, etc.) are requiring more and more computational power. The lack of embedded computational power is more significant in mass-produced robots because of the difficulties to follow the increasing computational requirements of state of the art algorithms. The integration of an additional GPU allows to overcome this lack of embedded computational power. We introduce in this paper a prototype of Pepper with an embedded GPU, but also with an additional 3D camera on the head of the robot and plugged to the late GPU. This prototype, called Adapted Pepper, was built for the European project called MuMMER (MultiModal Mall Entertainment Robot) in order to embed algorithms like OpenPose, YOLO or to process sensors information and, in all cases, avoid network dependency for deported computation.},

  abstract = {The development of wind power industry is one of the important ways to solve current energy shortage and reduce carbon emissions. As the key component to capture wind energy, fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) wind turbine blades are subject to complex alternating loads in harsh environments. It is easy to produce various damages during long-term service, such as cracks, fiber spalling, and surface abrasion. Among them, crack is the most serious damage. FRC is a kind of composite material with obvious anisotropy, which is very sensitive to crack damage. The generation and propagation of cracks can easily lead to further failure of the whole blade, resulting in great economic losses and safety risks. How to deal with the damage of wind turbine blades in time has become a thorny problem in the wind power industry. In this paper, the current research status of the crack damage for the FRC wind turbine blade is comprehensively reviewed from the formation mechanism of crack and the detection and evaluation methods as well as the repair technologies. Finally, the development of related technologies has been prospected.}

To date, publicly available laparoscopic image datasets are mostly limited to general classifications of data, semantic segmentations of surgical instruments and low-volume weak annotations of specific abdominal organs. The Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset provides semantic segmentations of eight abdominal organs (colon, liver, pancreas, small intestine, spleen, stomach, ureter, vesicular glands), the abdominal wall and two vessel structures (inferior mesenteric artery, intestinal veins) in laparoscopic view. In total, this dataset comprises 13195 laparoscopic images. For each anatomical structure, we provide over a thousand images with pixel-wise segmentations. Annotations comprise semantic segmentations of single organs and one multi-organ-segmentation dataset including segments for all eleven anatomical structures. Moreover, we provide weak annotations of organ presence for every single image. This dataset markedly expands the horizon for surgical data science applications of computer vision in laparoscopic surgery and could thereby contribute to a reduction of risks and faster translation of Artificial Intelligence into surgical practice.},

Our findings indicate that the previous guidelines for pre-training and fine-tuning, often blindly followed, do not always generalize well in the legal domain. Thus we propose a systematic investigation of the available strategies when applying BERT in specialised domains. These are: (a) use the original BERT out of the box, (b) adapt BERT by additional pre-training on domain-specific corpora, and (c) pre-train BERT from scratch on domain-specific corpora. We also propose a broader hyper-parameter search space when fine-tuning for downstream tasks and we release LEGAL-BERT, a family of BERT models intended to assist legal NLP research, computational law, and legal technology applications.},

Existing approaches to reveal learned concepts often rely on human supervision, such as pre-defined concept sets or segmentation processes. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised method for discovering distributed representations of concepts by selecting a principal subset of neurons. Our empirical findings demonstrate that instances with similar neuron activation states tend to share coherent concepts. Based on the observations, the proposed method selects principal neurons that construct an interpretable region, namely a Relaxed Decision Region (RDR), encompassing instances with coherent concepts in the feature space. It can be utilized to identify unlabeled subclasses within data and to detect the causes of misclassifications. Furthermore, the applicability of our method across various layers discloses distinct distributed representations over the layers, which provides deeper insights into the internal mechanisms of the deep learning model.},

A comparison is made with the gradient projection method for avoiding joint limits. While the gradient projection method provides the optimal direction for the joint velocity vector within the null space, its magnitude is not unique and is adjusted by a scalar coefficient chosen by trial and error. It is shown in this paper that one fixed value of the scalar coefficient is not suitable even in a small workspace. The proposed manipulation scheme automatically chooses an appropriate magnitude of the self-motion throughout the workspace. This scheme, unlike the gradient projection method, guarantees joint limit avoidance, and also minimizes unnecessary self-motion. It was implemented and tested for real-time control of a seven-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) Robotics Research Corporation (RRC) manipulator.{$<>$}},

Our approach leverages the strengths of both classical and learning-based methods, by using analytical path planners with learned SLAM module, and global and local policies. The use of learning provides flexibility with respect to input modalities (in the SLAM module), leverages structural regularities of the world (in global policies), and provides robustness to errors in state estimation (in local policies). Such use of learning within each module retains its benefits, while at the same time, hierarchical decomposition and modular training allow us to sidestep the high sample complexities associated with training end-to-end policies. Our experiments in visually and physically realistic simulated 3D environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over past learning and geometry-based approaches. The proposed model can also be easily transferred to the PointGoal task and was the winning entry of the CVPR 2019 Habitat PointGoal Navigation Challenge.},

  abstract = {Learning from diverse offline datasets is a promising path towards learning general purpose robotic agents. However, a core challenge in this paradigm lies in collecting large amounts of meaningful data, while not depending on a human in the loop for data collection. One way to address this challenge is through task-agnostic exploration, where an agent attempts to explore without a task-specific reward function, and collect data that can be useful for any downstream task. While these approaches have shown some promise in simple domains, they often struggle to explore the relevant regions of the state space in more challenging settings, such as vision based robotic manipulation. This challenge stems from an objective that encourages exploring everything in a potentially vast state space. To mitigate this challenge, we propose to focus exploration on the important parts of the state space using weak human supervision. Concretely, we propose an exploration technique, Batch Exploration with Examples (BEE), that explores relevant regions of the state-space, guided by a modest number of human provided images of important states. These human provided images only need to be collected once at the beginning of data collection and can be collected in a matter of minutes, allowing us to scalably collect diverse datasets, which can then be combined with any batch RL algorithm. We find that BEE is able to tackle challenging vision-based manipulation tasks both in simulation and on a real Franka robot, and observe that compared to task-agnostic and weakly-supervised exploration techniques, it (1) interacts more than twice as often with relevant objects, and (2) improves downstream task performance when used in conjunction with offline RL.},

However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to LLMs.},

  abstract = {Safety is a critical concern when deploying reinforcement learning agents for real-world applications. Recently, safe reinforcement learning algorithms have been developed to optimize the agent's performance while avoiding violations of safety constraints. However, few studies have addressed the nonstationary disturbances in the environments, which may cause catastrophic outcomes. In this paper, we propose the contextaware safe reinforcement learning (CASRL) method, a metalearning framework to realize safe adaptation in non-stationary environments. We use a probabilistic latent variable model to achieve fast inference of the posterior environment transition distribution given the context data. Chance constraints of safety are then evaluated with uncertainty-aware trajectory sampling. The high cost of safety violations leads to the rareness of unsafe records in the dataset. We address this issue by enabling prioritized sampling during model training and formulating sim-to-real prior safety constraints during constrained planning. The algorithm is evaluated in realistic safety-critical environments with non-stationary disturbances. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of safety and robustness.},

However, the code generated by LLMs is susceptible to errors. This work reports a preliminary exploration that empirically characterizes common errors produced by LLMs in robot programming. We categorize these errors into two phases: interpretation and execution. In this work, we focus on errors in execution and observe that they are caused by LLMs being ``forgetful'' of key information provided in user prompts. Based on this observation, we propose prompt engineering tactics designed to reduce errors in execution. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of these tactics with three language models: ChatGPT, Bard, and LLaMA-2. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from using LLMs in robot programming and call for the benchmarking of LLM-powered end-user development of robot applications.},

However, the intrinsically nonlinear dynamics and controllers make tuning a challenging task when it is done by hand. In this paper, we present DiffTune, a novel, gradient-based automatic tuning framework. We formulate the controller tuning as a parameter optimization problem. Our method unrolls the dynamical system and controller as a computational graph and updates the controller parameters through gradient-based optimization. The gradient is obtained using sensitivity propagation, which is the only method for gradient computation when tuning for a physical system instead of its simulated counterpart. Furthermore, we use {\textbackslash}mathcal L\_1 adaptive control to compensate for the uncertainties (that unavoidably exist in a physical system) such that the gradient is not biased by the unmodelled uncertainties. We validate the DiffTune on a Dubin's car and a quadrotor in challenging simulation environments. In comparison with state-of-the-art auto-tuning methods, DiffTune achieves the best performance in a more efficient manner owing to its effective usage of the first-order information of the system. Experiments on tuning a nonlinear controller for quadrotor show promising results, where DiffTune achieves 3.5x tracking error reduction on an aggressive trajectory in only 10 trials over a 12-dimensional controller parameter space.},

  abstract = {Robot learning methods have the potential for widespread generalization across tasks, environments, and objects. However, these methods require large diverse datasets that are expensive to collect in real-world robotics settings. For robot learning to generalize, we must be able to leverage sources of data or priors beyond the robot's own experience. In this work, we posit that image-text generative models, which are pre-trained on large corpora of web-scraped data, can serve as such a data source. We show that despite these generative models being trained on largely non-robotics data, they can serve as effective ways to impart priors into the process of robot learning in a way that enables widespread generalization. In particular, we show how pre-trained generative models can serve as effective tools for semantically meaningful data augmentation. By leveraging these pre-trained models for generating appropriate "semantic" data augmentations, we propose a system GenAug that is able to significantly improve policy generalization. We apply GenAug to tabletop manipulation tasks, showing the ability to re-target behavior to novel scenarios, while only requiring marginal amounts of real-world data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this system on a number of object manipulation problems in the real world, showing a 40\% improvement in generalization to novel scenes and objects.},

However, due to the complexity of the tasks and stochastic nature of human collaborators, it is quite challenging for the robot to efficiently collaborate with the humans. To address this challenge, in this letter, we first propose an algorithm to automatically construct a hierarchical task model from single-agent demonstrations. The hierarchical task model explicitly captures the sequential and parallel relationships of the task at all levels of abstraction. We then propose an optimization-based planner, which exploits the parallel relationships and prioritizes actions that are parallel to the humans' actions. In such a way, potential spatial interfaces can be avoided, task completion time can be reduced, and human's satisfaction level can be improved. We conducted simulations of a robot arm collaborating with a human for several collaborative tasks. The comparison results with several baselines proved that our proposed planner is better in terms of efficiency, safety and human satisfaction.},

However, we are still far from accurate, reliable, and resource-efficient operations of these systems. For robot perception, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection and pose estimation are recently coming into widespread use. However, neural networks are known to suffer from overfitting during the training process and are less robust under unforeseen conditions (which makes them especially vulnerable to adversarial scenarios). In this work, we propose Generative Robust Inference and Perception (GRIP) as a two-stage object detection and pose estimation system that aims to combine the relative strengths of discriminative CNNs and generative inference methods to achieve robust estimation. Our results show that a second stage of sample-based generative inference is able to recover from false object detections by CNNs, and produce robust estimations in adversarial conditions.

It is also prohibitively expensive to learn a new policy from scratch for each robot hardware due to the high sample complexity of modern state-of-the-art algorithms. We propose a novel approach called Hardware Conditioned Policies where we train a universal policy conditioned on a vector representation of robot hardware. We considered robots in simulation with varied dynamics, kinematic structure, kinematic lengths and degrees-of-freedom. First, we use the kinematic structure directly as the hardware encoding and show great zero-shot transfer to completely novel robots not seen during training. For robots with lower zero-shot success rate, we also demonstrate that fine-tuning the policy network is significantly more sample-efficient than training a model from scratch. In tasks where knowing the agent dynamics is important for success, we learn an embedding for robot hardware and show that policies conditioned on the encoding of hardware tend to generalize and transfer well.

The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.}

Much work has endeavored to design and build architectures automatically through clever construction of a search space paired with simple learning algorithms. Recent progress has demonstrated that such meta-learning methods may exceed scalable human-invented architectures on image classification tasks. An open question is the degree to which such methods may generalize to new domains. In this work we explore the construction of meta-learning techniques for dense image prediction focused on the tasks of scene parsing, person-part segmentation, and semantic image segmentation. Constructing viable search spaces in this domain is challenging because of the multi-scale representation of visual information and the necessity to operate on high resolution imagery. Based on a survey of techniques in dense image prediction, we construct a recursive search space and demonstrate that even with efficient random search, we can identify architectures that outperform human-invented architectures and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three dense prediction tasks including 82.7\% on Cityscapes (street scene parsing), 71.3\% on PASCAL-Person-Part (person-part segmentation), and 87.9\% on PASCAL VOC 2012 (semantic image segmentation). Additionally, the resulting architecture is more computationally efficient, requiring half the parameters and half the computational cost as previous state of the art systems.}

  abstract = {Developing fast gaits for legged robots is a difficult task that requires optimizing parameters in a highly irregular, multidimensional space. In the past, walk optimization for quadruped robots, namely the Sony AIBO robot, was done by handtuning the parameterized gaits. In addition to requiring a lot of time and human expertise, this process produced sub-optimal results. Several recent projects have focused on using machine learning to automate the parameter search. Algorithms utilizing Powell's minimization method and policy gradient reinforcement learning have shown significant improvement over previous walk optimization results. In this paper we present a new algorithm for walk optimization based on an evolutionary approach. Unlike previous methods, our algorithm does not attempt to approximate the gradient of the multidimensional space. This makes it more robust to noise in parameter evaluations and avoids prematurely converging to local optima, a problem encountered by both of the previously suggested algorithms. Our evolutionary algorithm matches the best previous learning method, achieving several different walks of high quality. Furthermore, the best learned walks represent an impressive 20\% improvement over our own best hand-tuned walks.},

Analyses from the two experiments provide evidence that: a) Human-Initiative (HI) systems outperform systems with single modes of operation, such as pure teleoperation, in navigation tasks; b) in the context of the simulated robot experiment, Mixed-Initiative (MI) systems provide improved performance in navigation tasks, improved operator performance in cognitive demanding secondary tasks, and improved operator workload compared to HI. Results also reinforce previous human-robot interaction evidence regarding the importance of the operator's personality traits and their trust in the autonomous system. Lastly, our experiment on a physical robot provides empirical evidence that identify two major challenges for MI control: a) the design of context-aware MI control systems; and b) the conflict for control between the robot's MI control system and the operator. Insights regarding these challenges are discussed and ways to tackle them are proposed.},

  abstract = {For sophisticated reinforcement learning (RL) systems to interact usefully with real-world environments, we need to communicate complex goals to these systems. In this work, we explore goals defined in terms of (non-expert) human preferences between pairs of trajectory segments. Our approach separates learning the goal from learning the behavior to achieve it. We show that this approach can effectively solve complex RL tasks without access to the reward function, including Atari games and simulated robot locomotion, while providing feedback on about 0.1\% of our agent's interactions with the environment. This reduces the cost of human oversight far enough that it can be practically applied to state-of-the-art RL systems. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we show that we can successfully train complex novel behaviors with about an hour of human time. These behaviors and environments are considerably more complex than any which have been previously learned from human feedback.}

Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.},

World-wide wind energy capacity continues to grow with 1870 TW h in 2021, with annual additions of 113 GW in 2020 and 59 GW in 2019 with over 90\% of the growth as a result of offshore wind farm installations. To attain 2050 net zero targets annual capacity additions of 250 GW are expected. Wind turbine assets require regular inspection and maintenance to ensure performance, compliance to standards and insurance requirements. A range of approaches are used in inspection and maintenance including airborne and platform mounted technologies, robots, as well as accessing the blades directly with rope assisted technicians. In addition to reviewing the merits and challenges associated with a range of approaches to offshore horizontal axis wind turbine maintenance this paper describes the design, trialling and in-service operation of a hexapod robot, along with options for its deployment. The robot is capable of deploying a wide range of measuring equipment and maintenance tools. The hexapod gait employed enables the chassis to be an end-effector, avoiding the use of traditional robot arms and the multiple degrees of freedom associated with the robot legs enable the robot to walk on both convex and concave surfaces as well as straddle a leading-edge profile on a wind turbine aerofoil. The robots have demonstrated functionality through multiple blade walks and tasks such as lightning protection system verification, inspections and blade surface treatments. The robot has the capability to work independently or alongside rope-assisted technicians.},

Aiming at supporting this dimension in image understanding, we address the problem of describing textures with semantic attributes. We identify a vocabulary of forty-seven texture terms and use them to describe a large dataset of patterns collected "in the wild". The resulting Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) is a basis to seek the best representation for recognizing describable texture attributes in images. We port from object recognition to texture recognition the Improved Fisher Vector (IFV) and Deep Convolutional-network Activation Features (DeCAF), and show that surprisingly, they both outperform specialized texture descriptors not only on our problem, but also in established material recognition datasets. We also show that our describable attributes are excellent texture descriptors, transferring between datasets and tasks, in particular, combined with IFV and DeCAF, they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art by more than 10\% on both FMD and KTH-TIPS-2b benchmarks. We also demonstrate that they produce intuitive descriptions of materials and Internet images.},

In this paper we analyse the benefits of NAS for image classification tasks under strict computational constraints. Our aim is to automate the design of highly efficient deep neural networks, capable of offering fast and accurate predictions and that could be deployed on a low-memory, low-power system-on-chip. The task thus becomes a three-party trade-off between accuracy, computational complexity, and memory requirements. To address this concern, we propose Multi-Scale Resource-Aware Neural Architecture Search (MS-RANAS). We employ a one-shot architecture search approach in order to obtain a reduced search cost and we focus on an anytime prediction setting. Through the usage of multiple-scaled features and early classifiers, we achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy-speed trade-off.},

  abstract = {Developing robot agnostic software frameworks involves synthesizing the disparate fields of robotic theory and software engineering while simultaneously accounting for a large variability in hardware designs and control paradigms. As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase, the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high, even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in robotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic applications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices found for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an open-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1) quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2) automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its components. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt! is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing standardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific configuration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These best practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles applicable to other robotic software. The approaches for lowering the entry barrier are evaluated by usage statistics, a user survey, and compared against our design objectives for their effectiveness to users.},

  abstract = {Behavior Trees (BTs) provide a way to structure the behavior of an artificial agent such as a robot or a non-player character in a computer game. Traditional design methods, such as finite state machines, are known to produce brittle behaviors when complexity increases, making it very hard to add features without breaking existing functionality.　 BTs were created to address this very problem, and enables the creation of systems that are both modular and reactive. Behavior Trees in Robotics and AI: An Introduction provides a broad introduction as well as an in-depth exploration of the topic, and is the first comprehensive book on the use of BTs. This book introduces the subject of BTs from simple topics, such as semantics and design principles, to complex topics, such as learning and task planning. For each topic, the authors provide a set of examples, ranging from simple illustrations to realistic complex behaviors, to enable the reader to successfully combine theory with practice. Starting with an introduction to BTs, the book then describes how BTs relate to, and in many cases, generalize earlier switching structures, or control architectures. These ideas are then used as a foundation for a set of efficient and easy to use design principles. The book then presents a set of important extensions and provides a set of tools for formally analyzing these extensions using a state space formulation of BTs.  With the new analysis tools, the book then formalizes the descriptions of how BTs generalize earlier approaches and shows how BTs can be automatically generated using planning and learning. The final part of the book provides an extended set of tools to capture the behavior of Stochastic BTs, where the outcomes of actions are described by probabilities. These tools enable the computation of both success probabilities and time to completion. This book targets a broad audience, including both students and professionals interested in modeling complex behaviors for robots, game characters, or other AI agents. Readers can choose at which depth and pace they want to learn the subject, depending on their needs and background.},

In this work, we explore the use of uncertainty estimation techniques and metrics for deep neural networks based on Monte-Carlo sampling and apply them to the problem of skin lesion classification on data from ISIC Challenges 2018 and 2019.

However, this is often limited to teaching to grasp at a certain position, rather than grasping a certain object. In this paper, we propose a method that learns to grasp an arbitrary object from visual input. While other learning-based approaches for robotic grasping require collecting a large dataset, manually or automatically labeled in a real or simulated world, our approach requires a single demonstration. We present results on grasping various objects with the Franka Panda collaborative robot after capturing a single image from a wrist mounted RGB camera. From this image we learn a robot controller with a convolutional neural network to adapt to changes in the object's position and rotation with less than 5 minutes of training time on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU, achieving over 90\% grasp success rate.},

We investigate the computational complexity of providing a formally-correct and minimal explanation of a decision taken by a classifier. In the case of threshold (i.e. score-based) classifiers, we show that a complexity dichotomy follows from the complexity dichotomy for languages of cost functions. In particular, submodular classifiers allow tractable explanation of positive decisions, but not negative decisions (assuming P{$\neq$}NP). This is an example of the possible asymmetry between the complexity of explaining positive and negative decisions of a particular classifier. Nevertheless, there are large families of classifiers for which explaining both positive and negative decisions is tractable, such as monotone or modular (e.g. linear) classifiers. We extend the characterisation of tractable cases to constrained classifiers (when there are constraints on the possible input vectors) and to the search for contrastive rather than abductive explanations. Indeed, we show that tractable classes coincide for abductive and contrastive explanations in the constrained or unconstrained settings. We show the intractability of returning a set of k diverse explanations even for linear classifiers and k=2. Finding a minimum-cardinality explanation is tractable for the family of modular classifiers, i.e. when the score function is the sum of unary functions, but becomes intractable when any non-modular function is also allowed.},

  abstract = {In the last years, neural networks achieved groundbreaking successes in a wide variety of applications. However, for safety critical tasks, such as robotics and healthcare, it is necessary to provide some specific guarantees before the deployment in a real world context. Even in these scenarios, where high cost equipment and human safety are involved, the evaluation of the models is usually performed with the standard metrics (i.e., cumulative reward or success rate). In this paper, we introduce a novel metric for the evaluation of models in safety critical tasks, the violation rate. We build our work upon the concept of formal verification for neural networks, providing a new formulation for the safety properties that aims to ensure that the agent always makes rational decisions. To perform this evaluation, we present ProVe (Property Verifier), a novel approach based on the interval algebra, designed for the analysis of our novel behavioral properties. We apply our method to different domains (i.e., mapless navigation for mobile robots, trajectory generation for manipulators, and the standard ACAS benchmark). Results show that the violation rate computed by ProVe provides a good evaluation for the safety of trained models.},

  abstract = {To control how a robot moves, motion planning algorithms must compute paths in high-dimensional state spaces while accounting for physical constraints related to motors and joints, generating smooth and stable motions, avoiding obstacles, and preventing collisions. A motion planning algorithm must therefore balance competing demands, and should ideally incorporate uncertainty to handle noise, model errors, and facilitate deployment in complex environments. To address these issues, we introduce a framework for robot motion planning based on variational Gaussian processes, which unifies and generalizes various probabilistic-inference-based motion planning algorithms, and connects them with optimization-based planners. Our framework provides a principled and flexible way to incorporate equality-based, inequality-based, and soft motion-planning constraints during end-to-end training, is straightforward to implement, and provides both interval-based and Monte-Carlo-based uncertainty estimates. We conduct experiments using different environments and robots, comparing against baseline approaches based on the feasibility of the planned paths, and obstacle avoidance quality. Results show that our proposed approach yields a good balance between success rates and path quality.},

He applies this view to a number of psychological and philosophical problems (such as paradox and illusion) and suggests possible experiments to test his theory.

  abstract = {The number of academic papers in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications across business and management domains has risen significantly in the last decade, and that rise has been followed by an increase in the number of systematic literature reviews. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail.},

PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

  abstract = {Managing modularity and commonality in product development more and more needs modularity and commonality in the production process, with the objectives of reducing manufacturing costs, time to market and improving quality. A critical issue is the way of managing data, information and knowledge: data most of the time structured according to data models, often using proprietary formats, leading to consistency problems for the exchanges. The use of international standards is a good way of improving quality of the information systems used in production management, since they facilitate interoperability of the software tools used. They also contribute to the integration of the production process in a product life cycle management-based approach. This study presents the ISO 15531 MANDATE standard for the exchanges of industrial manufacturing management data. In terms of industrial maturity, MANDATE is a new standard, whose development is based on research work done by the authors and whose parts have not reached the IS status (necessary for sake of stability) at the same time. For this reason, the different models proposed by the standard have not been implemented altogether at the same time. Indeed numerous standards do exist in the domain of production information management, however the information models proposed are not always compatible in between them, the vocabulary used is not defined in the same way even though the terms used are the same: ontology-based approaches are sometimes necessary to find the common `essence' of the information handled, but they can be integrated in software interfaces, thus making easier to convey a higher level of semantics in the exchanges. This study presents one of those approaches, defined in the INTEROP NoE EC funded project.},

  abstract = {We present a method for effectively planning the motion trajectory of robots in manufacturing tasks, the tool paths of which are usually complex and have a large number of discrete time constraints as waypoints. Kinematic redundancy also exists in these robotic systems. The jerk of motion is optimized in our trajectory planning method at the meanwhile of fabrication process to improve the quality of fabrication. Our method is based on a sampling strategy and consists of two major parts. After determining an initial path by graph search, a greedy algorithm is adopted to optimize a path by locally applying adaptive filers in the regions with large jerks. The filtered result is obtained by numerical optimization. In order to achieve efficient computation, an adaptive sampling method is developed for learning a collision-indication function that is represented as a support-vector machine. Applications in robot-assisted 3-D printing are given in this article to demonstrate the functionality of our approach. Note to Practitioners-In robot-assisted manufacturing applications, robotic arms are employed to realize the motion of workpieces (or machining tools) specified as a sequence of waypoints with the positions of tool tip and the tool orientations constrained. The required degree of freedom (DOF) is often less than the robotic hardware system (e.g., a robotic arm has six-DOF). Specifically, rotations of the workpiece around the axis of a tool can be arbitrary (see Fig. 1 for an example). By using this redundancy, i.e., there are many possible poses of a robotic arm to realize a given waypoint, the trajectory of robots can be optimized to consider the performance of motion in velocity, acceleration, and jerk in the joint space. In addition, when fabricating complex models, each tool path can have a large amount of waypoints. It is crucial for a motion planning algorithm to compute a smooth and collision-free trajectory of robot to improve the fabrication quality. The time taken by the planning algorithm should not significantly lengthen the total manufacturing time; ideally, it would remain hidden as computing motions for a layer can be done while the previous layer is printing. The method presented in this article provides an efficient framework to tackle this problem. The framework has been well tested on our robot-assisted additive manufacturing system to demonstrate its effectiveness and can be generally applied to other robot-assisted manufacturing systems.},

In this paper, we will introduce and define a family of approaches to AI safety, which we will refer to as guaranteed safe (GS) AI. The core feature of these approaches is that they aim to produce AI systems which are equipped with high-assurance quantitative safety guarantees. This is achieved by the interplay of three core components: a world model (which provides a mathematical description of how the AI system affects the outside world), a safety specification (which is a mathematical description of what effects are acceptable), and a verifier (which provides an auditable proof certificate that the AI satisfies the safety specification relative to the world model). We outline a number of approaches for creating each of these three core components, describe the main technical challenges, and suggest a number of potential solutions to them. We also argue for the necessity of this approach to AI safety, and for the inadequacy of the main alternative approaches.},

  abstract = {Robot learning has emerged as a promising tool for taming the complexity and diversity of the real world. Methods based on high-capacity models, such as deep networks, hold the promise of providing effective generalization to a wide range of open-world environments. However, these same methods typically require large amounts of diverse training data to generalize effectively. In contrast, most robotic learning experiments are small-scale, single-domain, and single-robot. This leads to a frequent tension in robotic learning: how can we learn generalizable robotic controllers without having to collect impractically large amounts of data for each separate experiment? In this paper, we propose RoboNet, an open database for sharing robotic experience, which provides an initial pool of 15 million video frames, from 7 different robot platforms, and study how it can be used to learn generalizable models for vision-based robotic manipulation. We combine the dataset with two different learning algorithms: visual foresight, which uses forward video prediction models, and supervised inverse models. Our experiments test the learned algorithms' ability to work across new objects, new tasks, new scenes, new camera viewpoints, new grippers, or even entirely new robots. In our final experiment, we find that by pre-training on RoboNet and fine-tuning on data from a held-out Franka or Kuka robot, we can exceed the performance of a robot-specific training approach that uses 4x-20x more data.

  abstract = {Reactive trajectory optimization for robotics presents formidable challenges, demanding the rapid generation of purposeful robot motion in complex and swiftly changing dynamic environments. While much existing research predominantly addresses robotic motion planning with predefined objectives, emerging problems in robotic trajectory optimization frequently involve dynamically evolving objectives and stochastic motion dynamics. However, effectively addressing such reactive trajectory optimization challenges for robot manipulators proves difficult due to inefficient, high-dimensional trajectory representations and a lack of consideration for time optimization.In response, we introduce a novel trajectory optimization framework called RETRO. RETRO employs adaptive optimization techniques that span both spatial and temporal dimensions. As a result, it achieves a remarkable computing complexity of O(T2.4)+O(Tn2), a significant improvement over the traditional application of DDP, which leads to a complexity of O(n4) when reasonable time step sizes are used. To evaluate RETRO's performance in terms of error, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of its regret bounds, comparing it to an Oracle value function obtained through an Oracle trajectory optimization algorithm. Our analytical findings demonstrate that RETRO's total regret can be upper-bounded by a function of the chosen time step size. Moreover, our approach delivers smoothly optimized robot trajectories within the joint space, offering flexibility and adaptability for various tasks. It can seamlessly integrate task-specific requirements such as collision avoidance while maintaining real-time control rates. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive simulations and real-world robot experiments in closed-loop manipulation scenarios.For further details and supplementary materials, please visit: https://sites.google.com/view/retro-optimal-control/home},

Robot trajectories can be programmed automatically by a genetic algorithm, providing the algorithm will consider the order and varying lengths of trajectories. A genetic, adaptive, heuristic algorithm which is designed to optimize robot trajectories is described. Though the model presented is a general model for redundant structures and could represent any n-link structures, it was applied to a 3-link structure. The performance of the genetic algorithm shows characteristic improvements when compared with that of a hill-climb and random search algorithm.{$<>$}},

The literature documents a development from the use of neural networks as explicit inverses to neural network iterative inversion (NNII) and, finally, to Bayesian neural network iterative inversion (BNNII), which adds a Bayesian superstructure to NNII. Inverse problems have been often considered ill posed, i.e. the statement of the problem does not thoroughly constrain the solution space. BNNII takes advantage of this lack of information by adding additional informative constraints to the problem solution using Bayesian methodology. This paper extends BNNII, showing how ground truth information, information regarding the particular parameter contour under reconstruction, and information regarding the underlying physical process, can be seamlessly added to the problem solution. Remote sensing problems afford opportunities for inclusion of ground truth information, prior probabilities, noise distributions, and other informative constraints within a Bayesian probabilistic framework. We apply these Bayesian methods to a synthetic remote sensing problem, showing that the addition of ground truth information, which is naturally included through Bayesian modeling, provides a significant performance improvement.},

Specifically, in this paper we demonstrate how to perform backpropagation analytically through a physical simulator defined via a linear complementarity problem.  Unlike traditional finite difference methods, such gradients can be computed analytically, which allows for greater flexibility of the engine. Through experiments in diverse domains, we highlight the system's ability to learn physical parameters from data, efficiently match and simulate observed visual behavior, and readily enable control via gradient-based planning methods.

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

Currently, robots are often treated as a black box in this optimization process, which is the reason why derivative-free optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning are omnipresent. When gradient-based methods are used, models are kept small or rely on finite difference approximations for the Jacobian. This method quickly grows expensive with increasing numbers of parameters, such as found in deep learning. We propose an implementation of a modern physics engine, which can differentiate control parameters. This engine is implemented for both CPU and GPU. Firstly, this paper shows how such an engine speeds up the optimization process, even for small problems. Furthermore, it explains why this is an alternative approach to deep Q-learning, for using deep learning in robotics. Finally, we argue that this is a big step for deep learning in robotics, as it opens up new possibilities to optimize robots, both in hardware and software.},

  abstract = {Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and robotics for more than a decade since data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount of engineering knowledge, which is otherwise required. However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this article, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how a low-cost off-the-shelf robotic system can learn closed-loop policies for a stacking task in only a handful of trials---from scratch. Our manipulator is inaccurate and provides no pose feedback. For learning a controller in the work space of a Kinect-style depth camera, we use a model-based reinforcement learning technique. Our learning method is data efficient, reduces model bias, and deals with several noise sources in a principled way during long-term planning. We present a way of incorporating state-space constraints into the learning process and analyze the learning gain by exploiting the sequential structure of the stacking task.},

Human language is frequently ambiguous, and a robot's limited sensing makes complete understanding of a statement even more difficult. To address these challenges, we describe an approach for enabling a robot to engage in clarifying dialog with a human partner, just as a human might do in a similar situation. Given an unconstrained command from a human operator, the robot asks one or more questions and receives natural language answers from the human. We apply an information-theoretic approach to choosing questions for the robot to ask. Specifically, we choose the type and subject of questions in order to maximize the reduction in Shannon entropy of the robot's mapping between language and entities in the world. Within the framework of the G3 graphical model, we derive a method to estimate this entropy reduction, choose the optimal question to ask, and merge the information gained from the human operator's answer. We demonstrate that this improves the accuracy of command understanding over prior work while asking fewer questions as compared to baseline question-selection strategies.}

However, control of such manipulators is difficult because the inverse problem; i.e., the choice of a set of control variables which positions the manipulator at a desired target location, is underdetermined. This chapter has two main points. First, it provides a taxonomy of approaches to solving the inverse problem for dextrous manipulators which outlines the relationship between the standard robotics approaches and approaches using neural networks. Second, this chapter analyzes the topological structure of the kinematics problem, showing that the inverse kinematic structure generically decomposes into a finite number of solution branches, each corresponding roughly to the notion of ``posture,'' such that each solution branch can be described as the product of a one-to-one inverse map and a set of free parameters describing the redundancy. Using these geometric insights, one can then generate direct inverse functions for dextrous manipulators, with which the free parameters can be used flexibly during operation to optimize any user-specified side constraint.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ``ImageNet'', a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

The approach integrates both instantaneous task specification and estimation of geometric uncertainty in a unified framework. Major components are the use of feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which facilitate the task specification, and the introduction of uncertainty coordinates to model geometric uncertainty. While the focus of the paper is on task specification, an existing velocity- based control scheme is reformulated in terms of these feature and uncertainty coordinates. This control scheme compensates for the effect of time varying uncertainty coordinates. Constraint weighting results in an invariant robot behavior in case of conflicting constraints with heterogeneous units. The approach applies to a large variety of robot systems (mobile robots, multiple robot systems, dynamic human-robot interaction, etc.), various sensor systems, and different robot tasks. Ample simulation and experimental results are presented.},

  abstract = {Human pose estimation (HPE) in 3D is an active research field that have many applications in entertainment, health and sport science, robotics. In the last five years markerless motion captures techniques have seen their average error decrease from more than 10cm to less than 2cm today. This evolution is mainly driven by the improvements in 2D pose estimation task that benefited from the use of convolutional networks. However with the multiplication of different approaches it can be difficult to identify what is more adapted to the specifics of any applications. We suggest to classify existing methods with a taxonomy based on the performance criteria of accuracy, speed and robustness. We review more than twenty methods from the last three years. Additionally we analyze the metrics, benchmarks and structure of the different pose estimation systems and propose several direction for future research. We hope to offer a good introduction to 3D markerless pose estimation as well as discussing the leading contemporary algorithms.},

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters{\textasciitilde}(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3\% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.},

Particularly, for complex manipulation tasks which are subject to geometric constraints, spatial information and a rich semantic knowledge about objects, types, and functionality are required, together with the way in which these objects can be manipulated. In this line, this paper presents an ontological-based reasoning framework called Perception and Manipulation Knowledge (PMK) that includes: (1) the modeling of the environment in a standardized way to provide common vocabularies for information exchange in human-robot or robot-robot collaboration, (2) a sensory module to perceive the objects in the environment and assert the ontological knowledge, (3) an evaluation-based analysis of the situation of the objects in the environment, in order to enhance the planning of manipulation tasks. The paper describes the concepts and the implementation of PMK, and presents an example demonstrating the range of information the framework can provide for autonomous robots.},

  abstract = {Real-world tasks typically consist of a series of target-directed actions and often require choices about which targets to act on and in what order. Such choice behavior can be assessed from an optimal foraging perspective whereby target selection is shaped by a balance between rewards and costs. Here we evaluated such decision-making in a rapid movement foraging task. On a given trial, participants were presented with 15 targets of varying size and value and were instructed to harvest as much reward as possible by either moving a handle to the targets (hand task) or by briefly fixating them (eye task). The short trial duration enabled participants to harvest about half the targets, ensuring that total reward was due to choice behavior. We developed a probabilistic model to predict target-by-target harvesting choices that considered the rewards and movement-related costs (i.e., target distance and size) associated with the current target as well as future targets. In the hand task, in comparison to the eye task, target choice was more strongly influenced by movement-related costs and took into account a greater number of future targets, consistent with the greater costs associated with arm movement. In both tasks, participants exhibited near-optimal behaviour and in a constrained version of the hand task in which choices could only be based on target positions, participants consistently chose among the shortest movement paths. Our results demonstrate that people can rapidly and effectively integrate values and movement-related costs associated with current and future targets when sequentially harvesting targets.}

For example, a human has to demonstrate a new ``pick and place'' task each time the object or the target location has changed. However, obtaining the abstract representation of such task can significantly reduce the learning time as the human only has to teach the necessary parameters required for the successful execution, e.g. the location of an object. In this work, we present a framework which allows to extract general task structures which together with the obtained knowledge can improve and accelerate the teaching of new tasks. Additionally, our framework exploits the semantic similarities between task parameters in order to infer the possible structure of unknown tasks. Our proposed method utilises symbolic representations of tasks combined with an ontology which makes it applicable to different environments in various domains. We analysed our framework in an orange sorting scenario and a cleaning scenario to demonstrate that it allows reducing the time required for teaching from 136.3 to 53 seconds (61.12\%) and from 48.7 to 21 seconds (56.87\%) respectively compared to learning only by kinesthetic demonstrations.},

Automated planning enables robots to find plans to achieve complex, long-horizon tasks, given a planning domain. This planning domain consists of a list of actions, with their associated preconditions and effects, and is usually manually defined by a human expert, which is very time-consuming or even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for generating this domain automatically from human demonstrations. First, we automatically segment and recognize the different observed actions from human demonstrations. From these demonstrations, the relevant preconditions and effects are obtained, and the associated planning operators are generated. Finally, a sequence of actions that satisfies a user-defined goal can be planned using a symbolic planner. The generated plan is executed in a simulated environment by the TIAGo robot. We tested our method on a dataset of 12 demonstrations collected from three different participants. The results show that our method is able to generate executable plans from using one single demonstration with a 92\% success rate, and 100\% when the information from all demonstrations are included, even for previously unseen stacking goals.}

One feature of our system is the operator count, which keeps track of the application frequency of every operator within the demonstrations. In this extended abstract, we show that we can use the count to slim down domains with the goal of decreasing the search time for long-horizon planning goals. The conceptual idea behind our approach is that we would like to prioritize operators that have occurred more often in the demonstrations over those that were not observed so frequently. We, therefore, propose to limit the domain only to the most popular operators. If this subset of operators is not sufficient to find a plan, we iteratively expand this subset of operators. We show that this significantly reduces the search time for long-horizon planning goals.},

To solve these problems, we can use differentiable optimal control for which the gradients of the robot's motion with respect to the parameters are required. We propose a method to efficiently compute these gradients analytically via the differential dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm using sensitivity analysis (SA). We show that we must include second-order dynamics terms when computing the gradients. However, we do not need to include them when computing the motion. We validate our approach on the pendulum and double pendulum systems. Furthermore, we compare against using the derivatives of the iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR), which ignores these second-order terms everywhere, on a co-design task for the Kinova arm, where we optimize the link lengths of the robot for a target reaching task. We show that optimizing using iLQR gradients diverges as ignoring the second-order dynamics affects the computation of the derivatives. Instead, optimizing using DDP gradients converges to the same optimum for a range of initial designs allowing our formulation to scale to complex systems.},

Commonly, \$L\_2\$ regularization is used on the control inputs in order to minimize energy used and to ensure smoothness of the control inputs. However, for some systems, such as satellites, the control needs to be applied in sparse bursts due to how the propulsion system operates. In this paper, we study approaches to induce sparsity in optimal control solutions -- namely via smooth \$L\_1\$ and Huber regularization penalties. We apply these loss terms to state-of-the-art DDP-based solvers to create a family of sparsity-inducing optimal control methods. We analyze and compare the effect of the different losses on inducing sparsity, their numerical conditioning, their impact on convergence, and discuss hyperparameter settings. We demonstrate our method in simulation and hardware experiments on canonical dynamics systems, control of satellites, and the NASA Valkyrie humanoid robot.

The resulting high-dimensional energy minimization problem describes the deviation between an offline-defined reference model and a pre-processed camera image. An additional regularization term allows for assumptions about the object's hidden areas and increases the solver's numerical stability.

One such aid may be the superimposition of important structures (such as blood vessels and tumors) over a laparoscopic image stream. In liver surgery, this may be achieved by creating a dense map of the abdominal environment surrounding the liver, registering a preoperative model (CT scan) to the liver within this map, and tracking the relative pose of the camera. Thereby, known structures may be rendered into images from the camera perspective. This intraoperative map of the scene may be constructed, and the relative pose of the laparoscope camera estimated, using Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The intraoperative scene poses unique challenges, such as: homogeneous surface textures, sparse visual features, specular reflections and camera motions specific to laparoscopy. This work compares the efficacies of two state-of the-art SLAM systems in the context of laparoscopic surgery, on a newly collected phantom dataset with ground truth trajectory and surface data. The SLAM systems chosen contrast strongly in implementation: one sparse and feature-based, ORB-SLAM3,1\{3 and one dense and featureless, ElasticFusion.4 We find that ORB-SLAM3 greatly outperforms ElasticFusion in trajectory estimation and is more stable on sequences from laparoscopic surgeries. However, when extended to give a dense output, ORB-SLAM3 performs surface reconstruction comparably to ElasticFusion. Our evaluation of these systems serves as a basis for expanding the use of SLAM algorithms in the context of laparoscopic liver surgery and Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) more generally.\vphantom\}},

However, neuroscience has yet to explain the fundamental neural circuit mechanisms for flexibly representing and manipulating abstract concepts. This article will review the research on neural models for symbolic processing. The review first focuses on the question of how symbols could possibly be represented in neural circuits. The review then addresses how neural symbolic representations could be flexibly combined to meet a wide range of reasoning demands. Finally, the review assesses the research on program synthesis and proposes that the most flexible neural representation of symbolic processing would involve the capacity to rapidly synthesize neural operations analogous to lambda calculus to solve complex cognitive tasks.},

  abstract = {Making intelligent decisions is an essential capability of any robotic system. A reasoning component that solves this problem must combine all available skills of a robot to solve a complex task. This thesis investigates task planning as such a reasoning mechanism. The strength of automated planning lies in the fact that a planner only requires a description of a robot's skills and the goal to reach. From this it computes action sequences for arbitrary situations. To apply planning techniques to robotics we must ensure that these are able to deal with the continuous and geometric nature of real-world tasks. Therefore the first half of the thesis describes planning tasks that integrate external reasoners into the planning process. We consider planning operators to have a symbolic and geometric aspects. While planners deal very well with the former, symbolic task descriptions are not expressive enough for the latter. We introduce the concept of semantic attachments that connect a symbolic predicate like "is the cup graspable" with an external reasoner that computes this query. These allow us, for example, to describe and plan for mobile manipulation tasks soundly. Another issue is that we cannot describe geometrical choices such as where to place an object on a table as planning tasks are required to be finite. To solve this we generate different instantiations of planning operators reflecting different options during the planning process by an external procedure. This made it necessary to develop a new search algorithm for planning with infinite branching factors. This new algorithm outperforms classical search algorithms on manipulation planning tasks. The second half of the thesis investigates techniques for integrating task planning into robotic systems. First, we formulate properties of real-world tasks, e.g., unexpected action outcomes or uncertainty about the world. To tackle these we follow the concept of continual planning, where the planner is embedded in an observation, monitoring and replanning loop. We state what kind of simplifications we make to be able to apply our planner to real-world scenarios and specifically address under which assumptions such a system is guaranteed to reach a desired goal. We demonstrate this by implementing a complex mobile manipulation system. Finally we investigate multi-robot coverage search in 3d. Here, the robots have to observe a known three-dimensional environment as quickly as possible with their sensors. This is a challenging robotics task especially in 3d scenarios that also contains a task planning problem. First, we generate a set of high-quality view poses. A subset of these have to be visited in a short amount of time to cover the search area. We introduce greedy and planning based methods to solve this problem and compare these algorithms in simulation and real-world experiments. The main result of this thesis is our task planner Temporal Fast Downward with Modules (TFD/M) that extends a classical planner with the aforementioned planning techniques. This is used in our continual planning infrastructure that allows to embed this planner into a robotic system. Our evaluation in simulation and real-world experiments shows that task planning is a viable solution for high-level decision making in robotics. The techniques developed in this thesis are essential for that.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional recurrent neural network that predicts action sequences for task and motion planning (TAMP) from an initial scene image. Typical TAMP problems are formalized by combining reasoning on a symbolic, discrete level (e.g. first-order logic) with continuous motion planning such as nonlinear trajectory optimization. Due to the great combinatorial complexity of possible discrete action sequences, a large number of optimization/motion planning problems have to be solved to find a solution, which limits the scalability of these approaches.  To circumvent this combinatorial complexity, we develop a neural network which, based on an initial image of the scene, directly predicts promising discrete action sequences such that ideally only one motion planning problem has to be solved to find a solution to the overall TAMP problem. A key aspect is that our method generalizes to scenes with many and varying number of objects, although being trained on only two objects at a time. This is possible by encoding the objects of the scene in images as input to the neural network, instead of a fixed feature vector. Results show runtime improvements of several magnitudes.

  abstract = {Long-horizon manipulation tasks require joint reasoning over a sequence of discrete actions and their associated continuous control parameters. While Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches are capable of generating motion plans that account for this joint reasoning, they usually assume full knowledge about the environment (e.g. in terms of shapes, poses of objects) and often require computation times not suitable for real-time control.To overcome this, we propose a learning framework where a high-level reasoning network predicts, based on an image of the scene, a sequence of discrete actions and the parameter values of their associated low-level controllers. These controllers are parameterized in terms of a learned energy function, leading to time-invariant controllers for each phase. We train the whole framework end-to-end using a dataset of TAMP solutions computed using Logic Geometric Programming. A key feature is that the reasoning network determines the parameters of the controllers jointly, such that the overall task can be solved. Despite having no explicit representation of the geometry nor pose of the objects in the scene, our network is still able to accomplish geometrically precise manipulation tasks, including handovers and an accurate pointing task where the parameters of early actions are tightly coupled with those of later actions.

We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multimodal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internetscale language, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.}

  abstract = {Policies trained in simulation often fail when transferred to the real world due to the `reality gap' where the simulator is unable to accurately capture the dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to tackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and engineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to learn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too conservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world without the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system parameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of observations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the given parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate the observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement over naive domain randomization.

  abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.},

  abstract = {Autonomous robots require online trajectory planning capability to operate in the real world. Efficient offline trajectory planning methods already exist, but are computationally demanding, preventing their use online. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called Guided Trajectory Learning that learns a function approximation of solutions computed through trajectory optimization while ensuring accurate and reliable predictions. This function approximation is then used online to generate trajectories. This algorithm is designed to be easy to implement, and practical since it does not require massive computing power. It is readily applicable to any robotics systems and effortless to set up on real hardware since robust control strategies are usually already available. We demonstrate the computational performance of our algorithm on flat-foot walking with the self-balanced exoskeleton Atalante.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenge of robotic manipulation of elastically deforming objects. To this end, we model elastic objects using the Finite Element Method. Through a quasi-static assumption, we leverage sensitivity analysis to mathematically model how changes in the robot's configuration affect the deformed shape of the object being manipulated. This enables an interactive, simulation-based control methodology, wherein user-specified deformations for the elastic objects are automatically mapped to joint angle commands. The optimization formulation we introduce is general, operates directly within a robot's workspace and can readily incorporate joint limits as well as collision avoidance between the links. We validate our control methodology on a YuMi R IRB 14000, which we use to manipulate a variety of elastic objects.},

Besides the well-known Jacobian transpose and Jacobian pseudo-inverse methods, three others, borrowed from numerical analysis, are presented. Among them, two approximation methods avoid the explicit manipulability matrix inversion, while the third one is a slightly modified version of the Levenberg-Marquardt method (mLM). Their comparison is based on the evaluation of a short distance approaching the goal point and on their computational complexity. As the reference method, the Jacobian pseudo-inverse is utilized. Simulation results reveal that the modified Levenberg-Marquardt method is promising, while the first order approximation method is reliable and requires mild computational costs. Some hints are formulated concerning the application of Jacobian-based methods in practice.},

The robustness of the identification method and the sensitivity of the results to measurement errors and number of experimental tests are also analyzed.

Lack of this ability impedes the general acceptance of AI and robot systems in critical tasks. This paper examines what forms of explanations best foster human trust in machines and proposes a framework in which explanations are generated from both functional and mechanistic perspectives. The robot system learns from human demonstrations to open medicine bottles using (i) an embodied haptic prediction model to extract knowledge from sensory feedback, (ii) a stochastic grammar model induced to capture the compositional structure of a multistep task, and (iii) an improved Earley parsing algorithm to jointly leverage both the haptic and grammar models. The robot system not only shows the ability to learn from human demonstrators but also succeeds in opening new, unseen bottles. Using different forms of explanations generated by the robot system, we conducted a psychological experiment to examine what forms of explanations best foster human trust in the robot. We found that comprehensive and real-time visualizations of the robot's internal decisions were more effective in promoting human trust than explanations based on summary text descriptions. In addition, forms of explanation that are best suited to foster trust do not necessarily correspond to the model components contributing to the best task performance. This divergence shows a need for the robotics community to integrate model components to enhance both task execution and human trust in machines. Forms of explanation that are best suited to foster trust do not necessarily correspond to those components contributing to the best task performance.

  abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental research area in robotics. Sampling-based methods offer an efficient solution for what is otherwise a rather challenging dilemma of path planning. Consequently, these methods have been extended further away from basic robot planning into further difficult scenarios and diverse applications. A comprehensive survey of the growing body of work in sampling-based planning is given here. Simulations are executed to evaluate some of the proposed planners and highlight some of the implementation details that are often left unspecified. An emphasis is placed on contemporary research directions in this field. We address planners that tackle current issues in robotics. For instance, real-life kinodynamic planning, optimal planning, replanning in dynamic environments, and planning under uncertainty are discussed. The aim of this paper is to survey the state of the art in motion planning and to assess selected planners, examine implementation details and above all shed a light on the current challenges in motion planning and the promising approaches that will potentially overcome those problems.},

In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs.}

In this paper, we analyze the predictions made by a specific type of recurrent neural network, mixture density RNNs (MD-RNNs). These networks learn to model predictions as a combination of multiple Gaussian distributions, making them particularly interesting for problems where a sequence of inputs may lead to several distinct future possibilities. An example is learning internal models of an environment, where different events may or may not occur, but where the average over different events is not meaningful. By analyzing the predictions made by trained MD-RNNs, we find that their different Gaussian components have two complementary roles: 1) Separately modeling different stochastic events and 2) Separately modeling scenarios governed by different rules. These findings increase our understanding of what is learned by predictive MD-RNNs, and open up new research directions for further understanding how we can benefit from their self-organizing model decomposition.},

The REPL addresses a basic challenge of program synthesis: tiny changes in syntax can lead to huge changes in semantics. We train a pair of models, a policy that proposes the new piece of code to write, and a value function that assesses the prospects of the code written so-far. At test time we can combine these models with a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply our approach to two domains: synthesizing text editing programs and inferring 2D and 3D graphics programs.},

It emphasizes its new features, i.e., modularity, formal definition of the task, robust plan synthesis, and execution of each assembly step. A task definition language allows a formal description of the robot universe and the assembly task to be input to ROBOPLAN. The expert task planner is a non-linear backward chaining problem solver, using a goal driven depth-first strategy. The implemented search strategy has been tested in the assembly domain, but it could be used in other domains where planning is needed. The motion planner provides a non-optimal, safe robot trajectory; collision free path planning has not been included yet. A robot executable code is generated for each assembly step and monitored in real time. The error detection and recovery capability of the system is rather limited at present, since no sensors are used. The initial implementation of the system has been tested and evaluated on the assembly of a DC motor. The potential of extending this planning framework to other applications is also discussed.},

Despite this, it is challenging to program cobots for collaborative industrial tasks as the programming has two distinct elements that are difficult to implement: (1) an intuitive element to ensure that the operations of a cobot can be composed or altered dynamically by an operator, and (2) a human-aware element to support cobots in producing flexible and adaptive behaviours dependent on human partners. In this area, some research works have been carried out recently, but there is a lack of a systematic summary on the subject. In this paper, an overview of collaborative industrial scenarios and programming requirements for cobots to implement effective collaboration is given. Then, detailed reviews on cobot programming, which are categorised into communication, optimisation, and learning, are conducted. Additionally, a significant gap between cobot programming implemented in industry and in research is identified, and research that works towards bridging this gap is pinpointed. Finally, the future directions of cobots for industrial collaborative scenarios are outlined, including potential points of extension and improvement.},

  abstract = {A practical approach to robot reinforcement learning is to first collect a large batch of real or simulated robot interaction data, using some data collection policy, and then learn from this data to perform various tasks, using offline learning algorithms. Previous work focused on manually designing the data collection policy, and on tasks where suitable policies can easily be designed, such as random picking policies for collecting data about object grasping. For more complex tasks, however, it may be difficult to find a data collection policy that explores the environment effectively, and produces data that is diverse enough for the downstream task. In this work, we propose that data collection policies should actively explore the environment to collect diverse data. In particular, we develop a simple-yet-effective goal-conditioned reinforcement-learning method that actively focuses data collection on novel observations, thereby collecting a diverse data-set. We evaluate our method on simulated robot manipulation tasks with visual inputs and show that the improved diversity of active data collection leads to significant improvements in the downstream learning tasks.},

A manipulation skill is generally a high-dimensional policy. To achieve the desired sample efficiency, we need to exploit the inherent structure in this problem. With our approach, we propose to decompose the problem into analytically known objectives, such as motion smoothness, and black-box objectives, such as trial success or reward, depending on the interaction with the environment. The decomposition allows us to leverage and combine (i) constrained optimization methods to address analytic objectives, (ii) constrained Bayesian optimization to explore black-box objectives, and (iii) inverse optimal control methods to eventually extract a generalizable skill representation. The algorithm is evaluated on a synthetic benchmark experiment and compared with state-of-the-art learning methods. We also demonstrate the performance on real-robot experiments with a PR2.},

Many existing approaches to TAMP involve explicit descriptions of task primitives that cause discrete changes in the kinematic relationship between the actor and the objects. In this work we propose an alternative, fully differentiable approach which supports a large number of TAMP problem instances. Rather than explicitly enumerating task primitives, actions are instead represented implicitly as part of the solution to a nonlinear optimization problem. We focus on decision making for robotic manipulators, specifically for pick and place tasks, and explore the efficacy of the model through a number of simulated experiments including multiple robots, objects and interactions with the environment. We also show several possible extensions.},

  abstract = {We argue that artificial networks are explainable and offer a novel theory of interpretability. Two sets of conceptual questions are prominent in theoretical engagements with artificial neural networks, especially in the context of medical artificial intelligence: (1) Are networks explainable, and if so, what does it mean to explain the output of a network? And (2) what does it mean for a network to be interpretable? We argue that accounts of ``explanation'' tailored specifically to neural networks have ineffectively reinvented the wheel. In response to (1), we show how four familiar accounts of explanation apply to neural networks as they would to any scientific phenomenon. We diagnose the confusion about explaining neural networks within the machine learning literature as an equivocation on ``explainability,'' ``understandability'' and ``interpretability.'' To remedy this, we distinguish between these notions, and answer (2) by offering a theory and typology of interpretation in machine learning. Interpretation is something one does to an explanation with the aim of producing another, more understandable, explanation. As with explanation, there are various concepts and methods involved in interpretation: Total or Partial, Global or Local, and Approximative or Isomorphic. Our account of ``interpretability'' is consistent with uses in the machine learning literature, in keeping with the philosophy of explanation and understanding, and pays special attention to medical artificial intelligence systems.},

The non-deterministic workflow of such workspaces raises concerns over planning of task and actions among the resources, as the workcell is now a dynamic environment. Following these demands, this study introduces a solution in scheduling and assignment of assembly tasks to both human and robot resources, aiming for effective emergence of alternative task-resource assignment sequences.

As their size and expressivity increases, so too does the variance of the model, yielding a nearly ubiquitous over\_tting problem. Although mitigated by a variety of model regularisation methods, the common cure is to seek large amounts of training data--which is not necessarily easily obtained--that sufficiently approximates the data distribution of the domain we wish to test on. In contrast, logic programming methods such as Inductive Logic Programming offer an extremely data-efficient process by which models can be trained to reason on symbolic domains. However, these methods are unable to deal with the variety of domains neural networks can be applied to: they are not robust to noise in or mislabelling of inputs, and perhaps more importantly, cannot be applied to non-symbolic domains where the data is ambiguous, such as operating on raw pixels. In this paper, we propose a Differentiable Inductive Logic framework, which can not only solve tasks which traditional ILP systems are suited for, but shows a robustness to noise and error in the training data which ILP cannot cope with. Furthermore, as it is trained by backpropagation against a likelihood objective, it can be hybridised by connecting it with neural networks over ambiguous data in order to be applied to domains which ILP cannot address, while providing data efficiency and generalisation beyond what neural networks on their own can achieve.}

Our experimental results underscore the distinctive performance of the GPT-4 agent, especially in Component 3, where it is outstanding in task planning and achieved a success rate of 81.88\% across 10 samples in task completion. In conclusion, our study accentuates the transformative potential of LLM agents in industrial robotics and suggests specific avenues, such as visual semantic control and real-time feedback loops, for their enhancement.},

  abstract = {Existing work in translation demonstrated the potential of massively multilingual machine translation by training a single model able to translate between any pair of languages. However, much of this work is English-Centric, training only on data which was translated from or to English. While this is supported by large sources of training data, it does not reflect translation needs worldwide. In this work, we create a true Many-to-Many multilingual translation model that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages. We build and open-source a training data set that covers thousands of language directions with parallel data, created through large-scale mining. Then, we explore how to effectively increase model capacity through a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters to create high quality models. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly translating between non-English directions while performing competitively to the best single systems from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). We open-source our scripts so that others may reproduce the data, evaluation, and final M2M- 100 model},

It provides an alternative to employ human intelligence in the control of the robot remotely. We establish robotic teleoperation systems with a wearable multimodal fusion device. The device is integrated with 18 low-cost inertial and magnetic measurement units, which cover all segments of the arm and hand. The multimodal fusion algorithm based on extended Kalman filter is deduced to determine the orientations and positions of each segment. Then, the robotic teleoperation systems using the proposed device are designed. The novel teleoperation schemes can be applied for 11DOF robotic arm-hand system and 10DOF robotic arm-hand system, in which the operator's fingers are used for robotic hand teleoperation, and the arms with palm are used for robotic arm teleoperation. Meanwhile, the proposed robotic teleoperation systems are fully realized with a user-friendly human-machine interaction interface. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted with our robotic teleoperation system successfully.}

  abstract = {We propose a new method that uses deep learning techniques to solve the inverse problems. The inverse problem is cast in the form of learning an end-to-end mapping from observed data to the ground-truth. Inspired by the splitting strategy widely used in regularized iterative algorithm to tackle inverse problems, the mapping is decomposed into two networks, with one handling the inversion of the physical forward model associated with the data term and one handling the denoising of the output from the former network, i.e., the inverted version, associated with the prior/regularization term. The two networks are trained jointly to learn the end-to-end mapping, getting rid of a two-step training. The training is annealing as the intermediate variable between these two networks bridges the gap between the input (the degraded version of output) and output and progressively approaches to the ground-truth. The proposed network, referred to as InverseNet, is flexible in the sense that most of the existing end-to-end network structure can be leveraged in the first network and most of the existing denoising network structure can be used in the second one. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets on the tasks, motion deblurring, super-resolution, and colorization, demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method compared with other image processing algorithms.},

  abstract = {The groundbreaking transformations triggered by the Industry 4.0 paradigm have dramatically reshaped the requirements for control and communication systems within the factory systems of the future. The aforementioned technological revolution strongly affects industrial smart and distributed measurement systems as well, pointing to ever more integrated and intelligent equipment devoted to derive accurate measurements. Moreover, as factory automation uses ever wider and complex smart distributed measurement systems, the well-known Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm finds its viability also in the industrial context, namely Industrial IoT (IIoT). In this context, communication networks and protocols play a key role, directly impacting on the measurement accuracy, causality, reliability and safety. The requirements coming both from Industry 4.0 and the IIoT, such as the coexistence of time-sensitive and best effort traffic, the need for enhanced horizontal and vertical integration, and interoperability between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), fostered the development of enhanced communication subsystems. Indeed, established technologies, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, widespread in the consumer and office fields, are intrinsically non-deterministic and unable to support critical traffic. In the last years, the IEEE 802.1 Working Group defined an extensive set of standards, comprehensively known as Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), aiming at reshaping the Ethernet standard to support for time-, mission- and safety-critical traffic. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of the TSN Working Group standardization activity is provided, while contextualizing TSN within the complex existing industrial technological panorama, particularly focusing on industrial distributed measurement systems. In particular, this paper has to be considered a technical review of the most important features of TSN, while underlining its applicability to the measurement field. Furthermore, the adoption of TSN within the Wi-Fi technology is addressed in the last part of the survey, since wireless communication represents an appealing opportunity in the industrial measurement context. In this respect, a test case is presented, to point out the need for wirelessly connected sensors networks. In particular, by reviewing some literature contributions it has been possible to show how wireless technologies offer the flexibility necessary to support advanced mobile IIoT applications.},

  abstract = {In From Molecule to Metaphor, Jerome Feldman proposes a theory of language and thought that treats language not as an abstract symbol system but as a human biological ability that can be studied as a function of the brain, as vision and motor control are studied. This theory, he writes, is a "bridging theory" that works from extensive knowledge at two ends of a causal chain to explicate the links between. Although the cognitive sciences are revealing much about how our brains produce language and thought, we do not yet know exactly how words are understood or have any methodology for finding out. Feldman develops his theory in computer simulations -- formal models that suggest ways that language and thought may be realized in the brain. Combining key findings and theories from biology, computer science, linguistics, and psychology, Feldman synthesizes a theory by exhibiting programs that demonstrate the required behavior while remaining consistent with the findings from all disciplines.After presenting the essential results on language, learning, neural computation, the biology of neurons and neural circuits, and the mind/brain, Feldman introduces specific demonstrations and formal models of such topics as how children learn their first words, words for abstract and metaphorical concepts, understanding stories, and grammar (including "hot-button" issues surrounding the innateness of human grammar). With this accessible, comprehensive book Feldman offers readers who want to understand how our brains create thought and language a theory of language that is intuitively plausible and also consistent with existing scientific data at all levels.},

By performing demonstrations on a novel tablet interface, the time required for teaching is greatly reduced compared with using a real robot.

  abstract = {We provide a philosophical explanation of the relation between artificial intelligence (AI) explainability and trust in AI, providing a case for expressions, such as ``explainability fosters trust in AI,'' that commonly appear in the literature. This explanation relates the justification of the trustworthiness of an AI with the need to monitor it during its use. We discuss the latter by referencing an account of trust, called ``trust as anti-monitoring,'' that different authors contributed developing. We focus our analysis on the case of medical AI systems, noting that our proposal is compatible with internalist and externalist justifications of trustworthiness of medical AI and recent accounts of warranted contractual trust. We propose that ``explainability fosters trust in AI'' if and only if it fosters justified and warranted paradigmatic trust in AI, i.e., trust in the presence of the justified belief that the AI is trustworthy, which, in turn, causally contributes to rely on the AI in the absence of monitoring. We argue that our proposed approach can intercept the complexity of the interactions between physicians and medical AI systems in clinical practice, as it can distinguish between cases where humans hold different beliefs on the trustworthiness of the medical AI and exercise varying degrees of monitoring on them. Finally, we apply our account to user's trust in AI, where, we argue, explainability does not contribute to trust. By contrast, when considering public trust in AI as used by a human, we argue, it is possible for explainability to contribute to trust. Our account can explain the apparent paradox that in order to trust AI, we must trust AI users not to trust AI completely. Summing up, we can explain how explainability contributes to justified trust in AI, without leaving a reliabilist framework, but only by redefining the trusted entity as an AI-user dyad.},

Recently, a subcommunity of machine learning has focused on solving this problem with Sequential Model-based Bayesian Optimization (SMBO), demonstrating substantial successes in many applications. However, for computationally expensive algorithms the overhead of hyperparameter optimization can still be prohibitive. In this paper we mimic a strategy human domain experts use: speed up optimization by starting from promising configurations that performed well on similar datasets. The resulting initialization technique integrates naturally into the generic SMBO framework and can be trivially applied to any SMBO method. To validate our approach, we perform extensive experiments with two established SMBO frameworks (Spearmint and SMAC) with complementary strengths; optimizing two machine learning frameworks on 57 datasets. Our initialization procedure yields mild improvements for low-dimensional hyperparameter optimization and substantially improves the state of the art for the more complex combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem.},

However, a critical challenge in few-shot learning is task ambiguity: even when a powerful prior can be meta-learned from a large number of prior tasks, a small dataset for a new task can simply be too ambiguous to acquire a single model (e.g., a classifier) for that task that is accurate. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic meta-learning algorithm that can sample models for a new task from a model distribution. Our approach extends model-agnostic meta-learning, which adapts to new tasks via gradient descent, to incorporate a parameter distribution that is trained via a variational lower bound. At meta-test time, our algorithm adapts via a simple procedure that injects noise into gradient descent, and at meta-training time, the model is trained such that this stochastic adaptation procedure produces samples from the approximate model posterior. Our experimental results show that our method can sample plausible classifiers and regressors in ambiguous few-shot learning problems. We also show how reasoning about ambiguity can also be used for downstream active learning problems.}

Hence, we present the iCub-HRI library which provides convenience wrappers for components related to perception (object recognition, agent tracking, speech recognition, and touch detection), object manipulation (basic and complex motor actions), and social interaction (speech synthesis and joint attention) exposed as a C++ library with bindings for Java (allowing to use iCub-HRI within Matlab) and Python. In addition to previously integrated components, the library allows for simple extension to new components and rapid prototyping by adapting to changes in interfaces between components. We also provide a set of modules which make use of the library, such as a high-level knowledge acquisition module and an action recognition module. The proposed architecture has been successfully employed for a complex human--robot interaction scenario involving the acquisition of language capabilities, execution of goal-oriented behavior and expression of a verbal narrative of the robot's experience in the world. Accompanying this paper is a tutorial which allows a subset of this interaction to be reproduced. The architecture is aimed at researchers familiarizing themselves with the iCub ecosystem, as well as expert users, and we expect the library to be widely used in the iCub community.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {One option to address the challenge of demographic transition is to build robots that enable aging in place. Falling has been identified as the most relevant factor to cause a move to a care facility. The Hobbit project combines research from robotics, gerontology, and human--robot interaction to develop a care robot which is capable of fall prevention and detection as well as emergency detection and handling. Moreover, to enable daily interaction with the robot, other functions are added, such as bringing objects, offering reminders, and entertainment. The interaction with the user is based on a multimodal user interface including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, gesture recognition, and a graphical touch-based user interface. We performed controlled laboratory user studies with a total of 49 participants (aged 70 plus) in three EU countries (Austria, Greece, and Sweden). The collected user responses on perceived usability, acceptance, and affordability of the robot demonstrate a positive reception of the robot from its target user group. This article describes the principles and system components for navigation and manipulation in domestic environments, the interaction paradigm and its implementation in a multimodal user interface, the core robot tasks, as well as the results from the user studies, which are also reflected in terms of lessons we learned and we believe are useful to fellow researchers.},

In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form.

  abstract = {What is the right object representation for manipulation? We would like robots to visually perceive scenes and learn an understanding of the objects in them that (i) is task-agnostic and can be used as a building block for a variety of manipulation tasks, (ii) is generally applicable to both rigid and non-rigid objects, (iii) takes advantage of the strong priors provided by 3D vision, and (iv) is entirely learned from self-supervision. This is hard to achieve with previous methods: much recent work in grasping does not extend to grasping specific objects or other tasks, whereas task-specific learning may require many trials to generalize well across object configurations or other tasks. In this paper we present Dense Object Nets, which build on recent developments in self-supervised dense descriptor learning, as a consistent object representation for visual understanding and manipulation. We demonstrate they can be trained quickly (approximately 20 minutes) for a wide variety of previously unseen and potentially non-rigid objects. We additionally present novel contributions to enable multi-object descriptor learning, and show that by modifying our training procedure, we can either acquire descriptors which generalize across classes of objects, or descriptors that are distinct for each object instance. Finally, we demonstrate the novel application of learned dense descriptors to robotic manipulation. We demonstrate grasping of specific points on an object across potentially deformed object configurations, and demonstrate using class general descriptors to transfer specific grasps across objects in a class.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to dealing with uncertainty in planning have focused on finding plans that prevent all potential failures. Though such plans are robust, their creation is computationally expensive. This model of planning does not capture the facts that 1) many times the most likely branch of execution succeeds and 2) even when that branch fails, replanning during execu- tion frequently provides an alternate path to the goal. In reality, the only failures that need to be planned for before execution are those that are unrecoverable, thereby preventing achievement of the goals. We have developed a framework called Precautionary Planning that combines interleaved planning and execution with limited contingency planning. Precautionary Planning adopts the view that contingency planning should be a last resort and is not desirable when replanning is pos- sible. In this framework, a robust initial plan is gener- ated using a fast deterministic planner. Next, the plan is analyzed to find potential points of failure, which are identified as recoverable or unrecoverable. Recoverable failures are left in the plan and are repaired through replanning at execution time. For each unrecoverable failure, an attempt is made to improve the chances of recovery, by adding "precautionary" steps such as tak- ing along extra supplies or tools that would allow re- covery if the failure occurs.}

  abstract = {Due to the severe consequences of their possible failure, robotic systems must be rigorously verified as to guarantee that their behavior is correct and safe. Such verification, carried out on a model, needs to cover various behavioral properties (e.g., safety and liveness), but also, given the timing constraints of robotic missions, real-time properties (e.g., schedulability and bounded response). In addition, in order to obtain valid and useful verification results, the model must faithfully represent the underlying robotic system and should therefore take into account all possible behaviors of the robotic software under the actual hardware and OS constraints. These requirements put the rigorous verification of robotic systems at the intersection of at least three communities: the robotic community, the formal methods community, and the real-time systems community. Verifying robotic systems is thus a complex, interdisciplinary task that involves a number of disciplines/techniques (e.g., model checking, schedulability analysis, component-based design) and faces a number of challenges (e.g., formalization, scalability). For instance, the use of formal verification (formal methods community) is hindered by the state-space explosion problem, whereas schedulability analysis (real-time systems) is not suitable for behavioral properties. Moreover, current real-time implementations of robotic software are limited in terms of predictability and efficiency, leading to e.g., unnecessary latencies. This is flagrant, in particular, at the level of locking protocols in robotic software. Such situation may benefit from theoretical and practical findings of the real-time systems community. In this paper, we propose an interdisciplinary approach that, by joining forces of the different communities, provides a scalable and unified means to efficiently implement and rigorously verify real-time robots. First, we propose a scalable two-step verification solution that combines formal methods and schedulability analysis to verify both behavioral and real-time properties. Second, we devise a new multi-resource locking mechanism that is efficient, predictable and suitable for real-time robots, and show how it improves the latter's real-time behavior. In both cases, we show, using a real drone example, how our approach compares favorably to the literature. This paper is a major extension of the RTCSA 2020 publication ``A Two-Step Hybrid Approach for Verifying Real-time Robotic Systems''.},

However, when a plan is executed in a real environment it can encounter differences between the expected and actual context of execution. These differences can manifest as divergences between the expected and observed states of the world, or as a change in the goals to be achieved by the plan. In both cases, the old plan must be replaced with a new one. In replacing the plan an important consideration is plan stability. We compare two alternative strategies for achieving the stable repair of a plan: one is simply to replan from scratch and the other is to adapt the existing plan to the new context. We present arguments to support the claim that plan stability is a valuable property. We then propose an implementation, based on LPG, of a plan repair strategy that adapts a plan to its new context. We demonstrate empirically that our plan repair strategy achieves more stability than replanning and can produce repaired plans more efficiently than replanning.},

  abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots (AMR) are currently being introduced in many intralogistics operations, like manufacturing, warehousing, cross-docks, terminals, and hospitals. Their advanced hardware and control software allow autonomous operations in dynamic environments. Compared to an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system in which a central unit takes control of scheduling, routing, and dispatching decisions for all AGVs, AMRs can communicate and negotiate independently with other resources like machines and systems and thus decentralize the decision-making process. Decentralized decision-making allows the system to react dynamically to changes in the system state and environment. These developments have influenced the traditional methods and decision-making processes for planning and control. This study identifies and classifies research related to the planning and control of AMRs in intralogistics. We provide an extended literature review that highlights how AMR technological advances affect planning and control decisions. We contribute to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we propose an agenda for future research within this field.},

The aim is to include the costs of object deformations when planning the robot's motions and trade them off against the travel costs. We present our recently developed robotic system that is able to acquire deformation models of real objects. The robot determines the elasticity parameters by physical interaction with the object and by establishing a relation between the applied forces and the resulting surface deformations. The learned deformation models can then be used to perform physically realistic finite element simulations. This allows the planner to evaluate robot trajectories and to predict the costs of object deformations. Since finite element simulations are time-consuming, we furthermore present an approach to approximate object-specific deformation cost functions by means of Gaussian process regression. We present two real-world applications of our motion planner for a wheeled robot and a manipulation robot. As we demonstrate in real-world experiments, our system is able to estimate appropriate deformation parameters of real objects that can be used to predict future deformations. We show that our deformation cost approximation improves the efficiency of the planner by several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of wind turbines is of growing importance considering the transition to renewable energy. This paper presents a multi-robot-approach for automated wind turbine maintenance including a novel climbing robot. Currently, wind turbine maintenance remains a manual task, which is monotonous, dangerous, and also physically demanding due to the large scale of wind turbines. Technical climbers are required to work at significant heights, even in bad weather conditions. Furthermore, a skilled labor force with sufficient knowledge in repairing fiber composite material is rare. Autonomous mobile systems enable the digitization of the maintenance process. They can be designed for weather-independent operations. This work contributes to the development and experimental validation of a maintenance system consisting of multiple robotic platforms for a variety of tasks, such as wind turbine tower and rotor blade service. In this work, multicopters with vision and LiDAR sensors for global inspection are used to guide slower climbing robots. Light-weight magnetic climbers with surface contact were used to analyze structure parts with non-destructive inspection methods and to locally repair smaller defects. Localization was enabled by adapting odometry for conical-shaped surfaces considering additional navigation sensors. Magnets were suitable for steel towers to clamp onto the surface. A friction-based climbing ring robot (SMART--- Scanning, Monitoring, Analyzing, Repair and Transportation) completed the set-up for higher payload. The maintenance period could be extended by using weather-proofed maintenance robots. The multi-robot-system was running the Robot Operating System (ROS). Additionally, first steps towards machine learning would enable maintenance staff to use pattern classification for fault diagnosis in order to operate safely from the ground in the future.},

  abstract = {Natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) techniques provide a convenient interface to access databases, especially for non-expert users, to conduct various data analytics. Existing methods often employ either a rule-base approach or a deep learning based solution. The former is hard to generalize across different domains. Though the latter generalizes well, it often results in queries with syntactic or semantic errors, thus may be even not executable. In this work, we bridge the gap between the two and design a new framework to significantly improve both accuracy and runtime. In particular, we develop a novel CatSQL sketch, which constructs a template with slots that initially serve as placeholders, and tightly integrates with a deep learning model to fill in these slots with meaningful contents based on the database schema. Compared with the widely used sequence-to-sequence-based approaches, our sketch-based method does not need to generate keywords which are boilerplates in the template, and can achieve better accuracy and run much faster. Compared with the existing sketch-based approaches, our CatSQL sketch is more general and versatile, and can leverage the values already filled in on certain slots to derive the rest ones for improved performance. In addition, we propose the Semantics Correction technique, which is the first that leverages database domain knowledge in a deep learning based NL2SQL solution. Semantics Correction is a post-processing routine, which checks the initially generated SQL queries by applying rules to identify and correct semantic errors. This technique significantly improves the NL2SQL accuracy. We conduct extensive evaluations on both single-domain and cross-domain benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the previous ones in terms of both accuracy and throughput. In particular, on the state-of-the-art NL2SQL benchmark Spider, our CatSQL prototype outperforms the best of the previous solutions by 4 points on accuracy, while still achieving a throughput up to 63 times higher.}

Our knowledge graph-based approach to explainable process analyses represents a hybrid AI approach that integrates symbolic approaches of structured knowledge and interactive machine learning methods for making algorithmic procedures traceable and representing analysis results in a human-readable form. In order to display identified weaknesses and suitable improvement measures of analyzed business processes in a user-understandable way and to enable human-in-the-loop interactions, an explainable, user-friendly interface is required. While much attention is paid to the computational aspects of generating explanations, there is a need for further research into the design of explanation user interfaces. A systematic literature review was conducted to derive a design catalog, which was demonstrated and evaluated by developing a suitable XUI for our knowledge graph-based explainable process analysis.},

Existing models such as ARMA, ARIMA are mainly linear models and cannot describe the stochastic and nonlinear nature of traffic flow. In recent years, deep-learning-based methods have been applied as novel alternatives for traffic flow prediction. However, which kind of deep neural networks is the most appropriate model for traffic flow prediction remains unsolved. In this paper, we use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural network (NN) methods to predict short-term traffic flow, and experiments demonstrate that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based deep learning methods such as LSTM and GRU perform better than auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that GRU is applied to traffic flow prediction.},

First, normative and technical aspects of the AI alignment problem are interrelated, creating space for productive engagement between people working in both domains. Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify `true' moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people's moral beliefs. The final part of the paper explores three ways in which fair principles for AI alignment could potentially be identified.},

In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP.

  abstract = {Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning, deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task).},

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

In our work, we aim to train performant 3D generative models that synthesize textured meshes which can be directly consumed by 3D rendering engines, thus immediately usable in downstream applications. Prior works on 3D generative modeling either lack geometric details, are limited in the mesh topology they can produce, typically do not support textures, or utilize neural renderers in the synthesis process, which makes their use in common 3D software non-trivial. In this work, we introduce GET3D, a Generative model that directly generates Explicit Textured 3D meshes with complex topology, rich geometric details, and high fidelity textures. We bridge recent success in the differentiable surface modeling, differentiable rendering as well as 2D Generative Adversarial Networks to train our model from 2D image collections. GET3D is able to generate high-quality 3D textured meshes, ranging from cars, chairs, animals, motorbikes and human characters to buildings, achieving significant improvements over previous methods.},

However, the absence of a systematical benchmark inhibits the development of designing effective, efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solutions. To address this challenge, in this paper, we first conduct a systematical and extensive comparison over existing prompt engineering methods, including question representation, example selection and example organization, and with these experimental results, we elaborate their pros and cons. Based on these findings, we propose a new integrated solution, named DAIL-SQL, which refreshes the Spider leaderboard with 86.6\% execution accuracy and sets a new bar.To explore the potential of open-source LLM, we investigate them in various scenarios, and further enhance their performance with supervised fine-tuning. Our explorations highlight open-source LLMs' potential in Text-to-SQL, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the supervised fine-tuning. Additionally, towards an efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solution, we emphasize the token efficiency in prompt engineering and compare the prior studies under this metric. We hope that our work provides a deeper understanding of Text-to-SQL with LLMs, and inspires further investigations and broad applications.},

Current advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have achieved unprecedented impact across research communities and industry. Nevertheless, concerns about trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI were raised by influential thinkers. Many have identified the need for well-founded knowledge representation and reasoning to be integrated with deep learning and for sound explainability. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability via symbolic representations for network models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research results in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the key ingredients of the next wave of AI systems. We focus on research that integrates in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning. The insights provided by 20 years of neural-symbolic computing are shown to shed new light onto the increasingly prominent role of trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI. We also identify promising directions and challenges for the next decade of AI research from the perspective of neural-symbolic systems.}

  abstract = {This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of Gemini models in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases and we discuss our approach toward deploying them responsibly to users.},

  abstract = {Hierarchies are one of the most common structures used to understand and conceptualise the world. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning, which deals with the automation of world-relevant problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is the branch that represents and handles hierarchies. In particular, the requirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN planning to be very useful, and also to perform well. However, the history of almost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these issues, the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope with the requirements of real-world applications has been often questioned. As a remedy, we propose a framework-based approach where we first provide a basis for defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two models that comprise a large portion of HTN planners. Second, we provide a set of concepts that helps in interpreting HTN planners from the aspect of their search space. Then, we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of properties organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness, competence, computation and applicability. Furthermore, we select Web service composition as a real-world and current application, and classify and compare the approaches that employ HTN planning to solve the problem of service composition. Finally, we conclude with our findings and present directions for future work. In summary, we provide a novel and comprehensive viewpoint on a core AI planning technique.},

  abstract = {Hierarchies are the most common structure used to understand the world better. In galaxies, for instance, multiple-star systems are organised in a hierarchical system. Then, governmental and company organisations are structured using a hierarchy, while the Internet, which is used on a daily basis, has a space of domain names arranged hierarchically. Since Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning portrays information about the world and reasons to solve some of world's problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning has been introduced almost 40 years ago to represent and deal with hierarchies. Its requirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN planning to be very useful, but also to perform well. However, the history of almost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these issues, attention attracts the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope with the requirements of applications from the real world. We propose a framework-based approach to remedy this situation. First, we provide a basis for defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two models that comprise a large portion of HTN planners.

In fact, they may be closely connected both from an evolutionary and a neurophysiological viewpoint. Reaching seems to have evolved from the neural systems responsible for the active and precise positioning of the limb during locomotion; moreover, it seems to be organized in the spinal cord. The motor cortex and its corticospinal outflow are preferentially engaged when precise positioning of the limb is needed during locomotion and are also involved during reaching and active positioning of the hand near objects of interest. All of these motor activities require visuomotor coordination, and it is this coordination that could be achieved by the motor cortex and interconnected parietal and cerebellar areas.},

We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams without explicitly marked sequence ends. Without resets, the internal state values may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is an adaptive "forget gate" that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review an illustrative benchmark problem on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve a continual version of that problem. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves it in an elegant way.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning methods can achieve significant performance but require a large amount of training data collected on the same robotic platform. A policy trained with expensive data is rendered useless after making even a minor change to the robot hardware. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of adapting a policy, trained to perform a task, to a novel robotic hardware platform given only few demonstrations of robot motion trajectories on the target robot. We formulate it as a few-shot meta-learning problem where the goal is to find a meta-model that captures the common structure shared across different robotic platforms such that data-efficient adaptation can be performed. We achieve such adaptation by introducing a learning framework consisting of a probabilistic gradient-based meta-learning algorithm that models the uncertainty arising from the few-shot setting with a low-dimensional latent variable. We experimentally evaluate our framework on a simulated reaching and a real-robot picking task using 400 simulated robots generated by varying the physical parameters of an existing set of robotic platforms. Our results show that the proposed method can successfully adapt a trained policy to different robotic platforms with novel physical parameters and the superiority of our meta-learning algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods for the introduced few-shot policy adaptation problem.},

Harmonic drive gears are widely used in space applications, robotics, and precision positioning systems because of their attractive attributes including near-zero backlash, high speed reduction ratio, compact size, and small weight. On the other hand, they possess an inherent periodic positioning error known as kinematic error responsible for transmission performance degradation. No definite understanding of the mechanism of kinematic error as well as its characterization is available in the literature. In this paper, we report analytical and experimental results on kinematic error using a dedicated research Harmonic Drive Test Apparatus. We first show that the error referred to in the literature as kinematic error actually consists of a basic component, representing ``pure'' kinematic error, colored with a second component resulting from inherent torsional flexibility in the harmonic drive gear. The latter component explains the source of variability in published kinematic error profiles. The decomposition of the kinematic error into a basic component and a flexibility related component is demonstrated experimentally as well as analytically by matching a mathematical model to experimental data. We also characterize the dependence of the kinematic error on inertial load, gear assembly, and rotational speed. The results of this paper offer a new perspective in the understanding of the mechanism of kinematic error and will be valuable in the mechanical design of harmonic drive gears as well as in the dynamic modeling and precision control of harmonic drive systems. @DOI: 10.1115/1.1334379\#}

  abstract = {Robotic manipulation involves actions where contacts occur between the robot and the objects. In this scope, the availability of physics-based engines allows motion planners to comprise dynamics between rigid bodies, which is necessary for planning this type of actions. However, physics-based motion planning is computationally intensive due to the high dimensionality of the state space and the need to work with a low integration step to find accurate solutions. On the other hand, manipulation actions change the environment and conditions further actions and motions. To cope with this issue, the representation of manipulation actions using ontologies enables a semantic-based inference process that alleviates the computational cost of motion planning. This paper proposes a manipulation planning framework where physics-based motion planning is enhanced with ontological knowledge representation and reasoning. The proposal has been implemented and is illustrated and validated with a simple example. Its use in grasping tasks in cluttered environments is currently under development.},

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.},

A solution to the inverse kinematics is a vector of joint configuration coordinates that corresponds to a set of task space coordinates.

An iterative solution is presented that is suitable for any class of robots having rotary or prismatic joints, with any arbitrary number of degrees of freedom, including both standard and kinematically redundant robots. The solution can be obtained subject to specified constraints and based on certain performance criteria. The solution is based on a new rapidly convergent constrained nonlinear optimization algorithm which uses a modified Newton-Raphson technique for solving a system nonlinear equations. The algorithm is illustrated using as an example a kinematically redundant robot.},

We propose that the ventral stream of projections from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex plays the major role in the perceptual identification of objects, while the dorsal stream projecting from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region mediates the required sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at such objects.}

Applications range from creating custom-made toys to creating spare parts for the 3D-printer itself as well as medical applications such as skull parts, knee replacements and hip replacements. The research and development start-up company HB{\textbar}3D uses a 6 degrees-of-freedom robotic arm combined with a plasticating single-screw extruder and heated hose to create large-scale thermoplast products. One challenge is to scale up the 3D-printing process while ensuring a high-quality product. Feedback control looks promising in increasing the dimensional accuracy of large-scale printed objects by influencing the screw speed to minimize flow disruptions. The goal is to create a simulation of a model predictive controller and show that an output flow trajectory can be tracked within 1 percent accuracy. The flow response is modeled using a commercially available computational fluid dynamics software package (ANSYS FLUENT Academic Research version 18.1). This computationally intensive model is simplified using system identification techniques; resulting in a wiener model. Finally, a simulation of using a model predictive controller to track an output flow reference signal is then performed.}

In our ordinary environment, social robots could be important tools for education and entertainment (edutainment) in a variety of ways. This paper presents a Natural Programming System (NPS) that is geared to non-expert users. The main goal of such a system is to provide an enjoyable interactive platform for the users to build different programs within their social robot platform. The end-user can build a complex net of actions and conditions (a sequence) in a social robot via mixed-initiative dialogs and multimodal interaction. The system has been implemented and tested in Maggie, a real social robot with multiple skills, conceived as a general HRI researching platform. The robot's internal features (skills) have been implemented to be verbally accessible to the end-user, who can combine them into others that are more complex following a bottom-up model. The built sequence is internally implemented as a Sequence Function Chart (SFC), which allows parallel execution, modularity and re-use. A multimodal Dialog Manager System (DMS) takes charge of keeping the coherence of the interaction. This work is thought for bringing social robots closer to non-expert users, who can play the game of ``teaching how to do things'' with the robot.},

If that hypothesis was correct, we could more easily both understand our own intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient to predict the behavior of complex systems like brains, and substantial computation might be needed to simulate human-like intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that studying the kind of inductive biases that humans and animals exploit could help both clarify these principles and provide inspiration for AI research and neuroscience theories. Deep learning already exploits several key inductive biases, and this work considers a larger list, focusing on those which concern mostly higher-level and sequential conscious processing. The objective of clarifying these particular principles is that they could potentially help us build AI systems benefiting from humans' abilities in terms of flexible out-of-distribution and systematic generalization, which is currently an area where a large gap exists between state-of-the-art machine learning and human intelligence.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces Associative Compression Networks (ACNs), a new framework for variational autoencoding with neural networks. The system differs from existing variational autoencoders (VAEs) in that the prior distribution used to model each code is conditioned on a similar code from the dataset. In compression terms this equates to sequentially transmitting the dataset using an ordering determined by proximity in latent space. Since the prior need only account for local, rather than global variations in the latent space, the coding cost is greatly reduced, leading to rich, informative codes. Crucially, the codes remain informative when powerful, autoregressive decoders are used, which we argue is fundamentally difficult with normal VAEs. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CelebA show that ACNs discover high-level latent features such as object class, writing style, pose and facial expression, which can be used to cluster and classify the data, as well as to generate diverse and convincing samples. We conclude that ACNs are a promising new direction for representation learning: one that steps away from IID modelling, and towards learning a structured description of the dataset as a whole.},

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7\% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.},

However, little attention has been paid to joint human-robot teams. Making human-robot collaboration natural and efficient is crucial. In particular, grounding, situational awareness, a common frame of reference and spatial referencing are vital in effective communication and collaboration. Augmented Reality (AR), the overlaying of computer graphics onto the real worldview, can provide the necessary means for a human-robotic system to fulfill these requirements for effective collaboration.

We explored these questions through a two-year long case study of an organization in the international maritime trade that introduced automated algorithmic support for data analysis and prediction work. Drawing on a human--machine configuration perspective, we found that humans and the algorithm were configured and reconfigured in multiple ways over time as the organization dealt with the introduction of algorithmic analysis. In contrast to replacing human work, the emergent configurations required new roles and redistribution of extant expertise to augment and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the new configuration resembled a human-in-the-loop pattern, comprised of both the augmentation work of auditing (i.e. the generation of a ground truth and assessment of the algorithmic output against this) as well as the work of altering the algorithm and the data acquisition architecture. Our research points to the strategic importance of a human-in-the-loop pattern for organizational reflexivity to ensure that the performance of the algorithm meets the organization's requirements and changes in the environment.},

  abstract = {The original formulation of SharedPlans by B. Grosz and C. Sidner (1990) was developed to provide a model of collaborative planning in which it was not necessary for one agent to have intentions-to toward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneous approaches (J.R. Searle, 1990), this formulation provided for two agents to coordinate their activities without introducing any notion of irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated activities that directly decomposed into single-agent actions, did not address the need for agents to commit to their joint activity, and did not adequately deal with agents having only partial knowledge of the way in which to perform an action. This paper provides a revised and expanded version of SharedPlans that addresses these shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's (1990) definition of individual plans to handle cases in which a single agent has only partial knowledge; this reformulation meshes with the definition of SharedPlans. The new definitions also allow for contracting out certain actions. The formalization that results has the features required by Bratman's (1992) account of shared cooperative activity and is more general than alternative accounts (H. Levesque et al., 1990; E. Sonenberg et al., 1992).},

  abstract = {Visuomotor control (VMC) is an effective means of achieving basic manipulation tasks such as pushing or pick- and-place from raw images. Conditioning VMC on desired goal states is a promising way of achieving versatile skill primitives. However, common conditioning schemes either rely on task-specific fine tuning - e.g. using one-shot imitation learning (IL) - or on sampling approaches using a forward model of scene dynamics i.e. model-predictive control (MPC), leaving deployability and planning horizon severely limited. In this paper we propose a conditioning scheme which avoids these pitfalls by learning the controller and its conditioning in an end-to-end manner. Our model predicts complex action sequences based directly on a dynamic image representation of the robot motion and the distance to a given target observation. In contrast to related works, this enables our approach to efficiently perform complex manipulation tasks from raw image observations without predefined control primitives or test time demonstrations. We report significant improvements in task success over representative MPC and IL baselines. We also demonstrate our model's generalisation capabilities in challenging, unseen tasks featuring visual noise, cluttered scenes and unseen object geometries.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention. However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.},

However, generating detailed responses that are visually grounded is still a challenging task for these models. We find that even the current state-of-the-art LVLMs (InstructBLIP) still contain a staggering 30 percent of the hallucinatory text in the form of non-existent objects, unfaithful descriptions, and inaccurate relationships. To address this, we introduce M-HalDetect, a Multimodal Hallucination Detection Dataset that can be used to train and benchmark models for hallucination detection and prevention. M-HalDetect consists of 16k fine-grained annotations on VQA examples, making it the first comprehensive multi-modal hallucination detection dataset for detailed image descriptions. Unlike previous work that only consider object hallucination, we additionally annotate both entity descriptions and relationships that are unfaithful. To demonstrate the potential of this dataset for hallucination prevention, we optimize InstructBLIP through our novel Fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (FDPO). We also train fine-grained multi-modal reward models from InstructBLIP and evaluate their effectiveness with best-of-n rejection sampling (RS). We perform human evaluation on both FDPO and rejection sampling, and find that they reduce hallucination rates in InstructBLIP by 41\% and 55\% respectively. We also find that our reward model generalizes to other multi-modal models, reducing hallucinations in LLaVA and mPLUG-OWL by 15\% and 57\% respectively, and has strong correlation with human evaluated accuracy scores.

The XAI developer teams are addressing the first two challenges by creating ML techniques and developing principles, strategies, and human-computer interaction techniques for generating effective explanations. Another XAI team is addressing the third challenge by summarizing, extending, and applying psychologic theories of explanation to help the XAI evaluator define a suitable evaluation framework, which the developer teams will use to test their systems. The XAI teams completed the first of this 4-year program in May 2018.

Task and motion planning (TAMP) is a recent research method in Artificial Intelligence Planning for these applications. TAMP integrates high-level abstract reasoning with the low-level geometric feasibility check and thus is more comprehensive than traditional task planning methods. While regular TAMP approaches are challenged by different types of uncertainties and the generalization of various applications when implemented in real-world scenarios. This article systematically reviews the most relevant approaches to TAMP and classifies them according to their features and emphasis; it categorizes the challenges and presents online TAMP and machine learning-based TAMP approaches for addressing them.},

  abstract = {We present relay policy learning, a method for imitation and reinforcement learning that can solve multi-stage, long-horizon robotic tasks. This general and universally-applicable, two-phase approach consists of an imitation learning stage resulting in goal-conditioned hierarchical policies that can be easily improved using fine-tuning via reinforcement learning in the subsequent phase. Our method, while not necessarily perfect at imitation learning, is very amenable to further improvement via environment interaction allowing it to scale to challenging long-horizon tasks. In particular, we simplify the long-horizon policy learning problem by using a novel data-relabeling algorithm for learning goal-conditioned hierarchical policies, where the low-level only acts for a fixed number of steps, regardless of the goal achieved. While we rely on demonstration data to bootstrap policy learning, we do not assume access to demonstrations of specific tasks. Instead, our approach can leverage unstructured and unsegmented demonstrations of semantically meaningful behaviors that are not only less burdensome to provide, but also can greatly facilitate further improvement using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of multi-stage, long-horizon manipulation tasks in a challenging kitchen simulation environment.},

An amalgamation of information, communication, and artificial intelligence is taking place, as well as the cross-fertilization of a wide range of concepts, referred to as the digital transformation. While the discussion on how to operationalize the new intelligent systems of the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is still going on; the dominant characteristics of the fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 -- going beyond producing goods and services for profit -- requires all to think and act differently. As a result of the convergence phenomenon, the boundaries between different disciplines are eroding, necessitating a thorough discussion on what engineering education should be like in the future. In this paper, after presenting a brief history of engineering education, the recent paradigm changes are discussed, which essentially stress that skills must prevail over degrees to deal with challenges posed by the trends of the fifth industrial revolution. Later, before concluding the paper four strategies are presented such as lifelong learning and transdisciplinary education (1), sustainability, resilience, and human-centric design modules (2), hands-on data fluency and management courses (3) and human-agent/machine/robot/computer interaction experiences (4).},

Developing efficient exploration strategies capable of finding the most useful samples becomes critical in such settings. Existing approaches towards finding efficient exploration strategies add auxiliary objectives to promote exploration by the pre-update policy, however, this makes the adaptation using a few gradient steps difficult as the pre-update (exploration) and post-update (exploitation) policies are often quite different. Instead, we propose to explicitly model a separate exploration policy for the task distribution. Having two different policies gives more flexibility in training the exploration policy and also makes adaptation to any specific task easier. We show that using self-supervised or supervised learning objectives for adaptation allows for more efficient inner-loop updates and also demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to prior works in this domain.},

  abstract = {Deformable object manipulation (DOM) for robots has a wide range of applications in various fields such as industrial, service and health care sectors. However, compared to manipulation of rigid objects, DOM poses significant challenges for robotic perception, modeling and manipulation, due to the infinite dimensionality of the state space of deformable objects (DOs) and the complexity of their dynamics. The development of computer graphics and machine learning has enabled novel techniques for DOM. These techniques, based on data-driven paradigms, can address some of the challenges that analytical approaches of DOM face. However, some existing reviews do not include all aspects of DOM, and some previous reviews do not summarize data-driven approaches adequately. In this article, we survey more than 150 relevant studies (data-driven approaches mainly) and summarize recent advances, open challenges, and new frontiers for aspects of perception, modeling and manipulation for DOs. Particularly, we summarize initial progress made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic manipulation, and indicates some valuable directions for further research. We believe that integrating data-driven approaches and analytical approaches can provide viable solutions to open challenges of DOM.},

  abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.},

  abstract = {Differentiable programming has recently received much interest as a paradigm that facilitates taking gradients of computer programs. While the corresponding flexible gradient-based optimization approaches so far have been used predominantly for deep learning or enriching the latter with modeling components, we want to demonstrate that they can also be useful for statistical modeling per se, for example, for quick prototyping when classical maximum likelihood approaches are challenging or not feasible. In an application from a COVID-19 setting, we use differentiable programming to quickly build and optimize a flexible prediction model adapted to the data quality challenges at hand. Specifically, we develop a regression model, inspired by delay differential equations, that can bridge temporal gaps of observations in the central German registry of COVID-19 intensive care cases for predicting future demand. With this exemplary modeling challenge, we illustrate how differentiable programming can enable simple gradient-based optimization of the model by automatic differentiation. This allowed us to quickly prototype a model under time pressure that outperforms simpler benchmark models. We thus exemplify the potential of differentiable programming also outside deep learning applications to provide more options for flexible applied statistical modeling.},

Software-only robotics researchers usually rely on commercially available robots which, in the case of manipulators, are primarily designed for industrial purposes and are often far from their needs. This article is a hands-on tutorial on the Franka Emika robot, the first series of industrial artificial intelligence (AI)-ready tactile robot platforms. Beyond industrial use, the systems can be seamlessly expanded to fulfill the demands of research and education across all robotics and AI disciplines. To satisfy the needs of such a wide variety of fields, it provides three different interfaces: Desk, a high-level app-based user interface for easy and fast task programming; Robot Integrated Development Environment (RIDE), a command-based programming environment used to create high-performance robot skills that enables programming custom apps and integrating external sensors; and the Franka control interface (FCI), a 1-kHz low-level torque and position control interface that exploits the also-available Langrangian dynamics robot model. We take a close look at implementations with all interfaces, ranging from simple solutions, apps, and controllers to robot-learning examples illustrating how to exploit all the advantages of this platform in ongoing robotics research and education.},

  abstract = {We present a hierarchical planning and control framework that enables an agent to perform various tasks and adapt to a new task flexibly. Rather than learning an individual policy for each particular task, the proposed framework, DISH, distills a hierarchical policy from a set of tasks by representation and reinforcement learning. The framework is based on the idea of latent variable models that represent high-dimensional observations using low-dimensional latent variables. The resulting policy consists of two levels of hierarchy: (i) a planning module that reasons a sequence of latent intentions that would lead to an optimistic future and (ii) a feedback control policy, shared across the tasks, that executes the inferred intention. Because the planning is performed in low-dimensional latent space, the learned policy can immediately be used to solve or adapt to new tasks without additional training. We demonstrate the proposed framework can learn compact representations (3- and 1-dimensional latent states and commands for a humanoid with 197- and 36-dimensional state features and actions) while solving a small number of imitation tasks, and the resulting policy is directly applicable to other types of tasks, i.e., navigation in cluttered environments.},

The dominant portion of these surgical interventions has been performed with master-slave teleoperation systems, which are not capable of autonomous task execution or cognitive decision making. Much of the most advanced technologies foundered on the drawing boards or at the research labs for a long time, partially due to the fact that the surgical domain is resistant to the introduction of new hazards via the increased complexity of novel solutions. It has been seen with similar heavily regulated areas that internationally accepted standards can facilitate the adoption of new technologies in a safe manner. This paper reviews the existing autonomous capabilities of surgical robots, and investigates the major barriers of development presented by the lack of autonomy benchmarks and standards. The emerging safety standard environment is presented, as a key enabling factor to the commercialization of autonomous surgical robots. A practical scale is introduced to assess the level of autonomy of current and future surgical robots. Regarding the forthcoming robotic platforms, it is crucial to improve the transparency of the regulatory environment, streamline the standardization framework, and increase the social acceptance.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based decision support is becoming a growing issue in manufacturing and logistics. Users of AI-based systems have the claim to understand  the decisions made by the systems. In addition, users like workers or managers, but also works councils in companies, demand transparency in the use of AI. Given this background, AI research faces the challenge of making the decisions of algorithmic systems explainable. Algorithms, especially in the field of AI, but also classical algorithms do not provide an explanation for their decision. To generate such explanations, new algorithms have been designed to explain the decisions of the other algorithms post hoc. This subfield is called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Methods like local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), shapley additive explanations (SHAP) or layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) can be applied. LIME is an algorithm that can explain the predictions of any classifier by learning an interpretable model around the prediction locally. In the case of image recognition, for example, a LIME algorithm can highlight the image areas based on which the algorithm arrived at its decision. They even show that the algorithm can also come to a result based on the image caption. SHAP, a game theoretic approach that can be applied to the output of any machine learning model, connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations. It uses Shapley values as in game theory for the allocation. In the research of XAI, explanatory user interfaces and user interactions have hardly been studied. One of the most crucial factors to make a model understandable through explanations is the involvement of users in XAI. Human-computer interaction skills are needed in addition to technical expertise. According to Miller and Molnar, good explanations should be designed contrastively to explain why event A happened instead of another event B, rather than just emphasizing why event A occurred. In addition, it is important that explanations are limited to only one or two causes and are thus formulated selectively. In literature, four guidelines to be respected for explanations are formulated: use a natural language, use various methods to explain, adapt to mental models of users and be responsive, so a user can ask follow-up questions. The explanations are often very mathematical and a deep knowledge of details is needed to understand the explanations. In this paper, we present design guidelines to help make explanations of algorithms understandable and user-friendly. We use the example of AI-based algorithmic scheduling in logistics and show the importance of a comprehensive user interface in explaining decisions. In our use case, AI-based shift scheduling in logistics, where workers are assigned to workplaces based on their preferences, we designed a user interface to support transparency as well as explainability of the underlying algorithm and then evaluated it with various users and two different user interfaces. We show excerpts from the user interface and our explanations for the users and give recommendations for the creation of explanations in user interfaces.},

  abstract = {For service mobile robots to be most effective, it must be possible for non-experts and even end-users to program them to do new tasks. Regardless of the programming method (e.g., by demonstration or traditional programming), robot task programs are challenging to write, because they rely on multiple actions to succeed, including human-robot interactions. Unfortunately, interactions are prone to fail, because a human may perform the wrong action (e.g., if the robot's request is not clear). Moreover, when the robot cannot directly observe the human action, it may not detect the failure until several steps after it occurs. Therefore, writing fault-tolerant robot tasks is beyond the ability of non-experts. This paper presents a principled approach to detect and recover from a broad class of failures that occur in end-user programs on service mobile robots. We present a two-tiered Robot Task Programming Language (RTPL): 1) an expert roboticist uses a specification language to write a probabilistic model of the robot's actions and interactions, and 2) a non-expert then writes an ordinary sequential program for a particular task. The RTPL runtime system executes the task program sequentially, while using the probabilistic model to build a Bayesian network that tracks possible, unobserved failures. If an error is observed, RTPL uses Bayesian inference to find the likely root cause of the error, and then attempts to re-execute a portion of the program for recovery. Our empirical results show that RTPL 1) allows complex tasks to be written concisely, 2) correctly identifies the root cause of failure, and 3) allows multiple tasks to recover from a variety of errors, without task-specific error-recovery code.},

  abstract = {The introduction of inexpensive 3D data acquisition devices has promisingly facilitated the wide availability and popularity of 3D point cloud, which attracts more attention on the effective extraction of novel 3D point cloud descriptors for accurate and efficient of 3D computer vision tasks. However, how to de- velop discriminative and robust feature descriptors from various point clouds remains a challenging task. This paper comprehensively investigates the exist- ing approaches for extracting 3D point cloud descriptors which are categorized into three major classes: local-based descriptor, global-based descriptor and hybrid-based descriptor. Furthermore, experiments are carried out to present a thorough evaluation of performance of several state-of-the-art 3D point cloud descriptors used widely in practice in terms of descriptiveness, robustness and efficiency.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Initial learning curves are potentially shorter in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) than in conventional laparoscopic surgery (LS). There is little evidence to support this claim. Furthermore, there is limited evidence how skills from LS transfer to RAS. METHODS: A randomized controlled, assessor blinded crossover study to compare how RAS na{\"i}ve surgeons (n\,=\,40) performed linear-stapled side-to-side bowel anastomoses in an in vivo porcine model with LS and RAS. Technique was rated using the validated anastomosis objective structured assessment of skills (A-OSATS) score and the conventional OSATS score. Skill transfer from LS to RAS was measured by comparing the RAS performance of LS novices and LS experienced surgeons. Mental and physical workload was measured with the NASA-task load index (NASA-Tlx) and the Borg-scale. OUTCOMES: In the overall cohort, there were no differences between RAS and LS for surgical performance (A-OSATS, time, OSATS). Surgeons that were na{\"i}ve in both LS and RAS had significantly higher A-OSATS scores in RAS (Mean (Standard deviation (SD)): LS: 48.0\,{\textpm}\,12.1; RAS: 52.0\,{\textpm}\,7.5); p\,=\,0.044) mainly deriving from better bowel positioning (LS: 8.7\,{\textpm}\,1.4; RAS: 9.3\,{\textpm}\,1.0; p\,=\,0.045) and closure of enterotomy (LS: 12.8\,{\textpm}\,5.5; RAS: 15.6\,{\textpm}\,4.7; p\,=\,0.010). There was no statistically significant difference in how LS novices and LS experienced surgeons performed in RAS [Mean (SD): novices: 48.9\,{\textpm}\,9.0; experienced surgeons: 55.9\,{\textpm}\,11.0; p\,=\,0.540]. Mental and physical demand was significantly higher after LS. CONCLUSION: The initial performance was improved for RAS versus LS for linear stapled bowel anastomosis, whereas workload was higher for LS. There was limited transfer of skills from LS to RAS.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Point2Mesh, a technique for reconstructing a surface mesh from an input point cloud. Instead of explicitly specifying a prior that encodes the expected shape properties, the prior is defined automatically using the input point cloud, which we refer to as a self-prior. The self-prior encapsulates reoccurring geometric repetitions from a single shape within the weights of a deep neural network. We optimize the network weights to deform an initial mesh to shrink-wrap a single input point cloud. This explicitly considers the entire reconstructed shape, since shared local kernels are calculated to fit the overall object. The convolutional kernels are optimized globally across the entire shape, which inherently encourages local-scale geometric self-similarity across the shape surface. We show that shrink-wrapping a point cloud with a self-prior converges to a desirable solution; compared to a prescribed smoothness prior, which often becomes trapped in undesirable local minima. While the performance of traditional reconstruction approaches degrades in non-ideal conditions that are often present in real world scanning, i.e., unoriented normals, noise and missing (low density) parts, Point2Mesh is robust to non-ideal conditions. We demonstrate the performance of Point2Mesh on a large variety of shapes with varying complexity.},

We present a novel adaptive rendering method that increases temporal stability and image fidelity of low sample count path tracing by distributing samples via spatio-temporal joint optimization of sampling and denoising. Adding temporal optimization to the sample predictor enables it to learn spatio-temporal sampling strategies such as placing more samples in disoccluded regions, tracking specular highlights, etc; adding temporal feedback to the denoiser boosts the effective input sample count and increases temporal stability. The temporal approach also allows us to remove the initial uniform sampling step typically present in adaptive sampling algorithms. The sample predictor and denoiser are deep neural networks that we co-train end-to-end over multiple consecutive frames. Our approach is scalable, allowing trade-off between quality and performance, and runs at near real-time rates while achieving significantly better image quality and temporal stability than previous methods.},

This structure shows that the conventional categorization of manipulators as either serial or parallel is incomplete and that three distinct categories of manipulator must be accounted for; (1) serial manipulators in which inputs globally determine outputs, (2) explicit parallel manipulators in which outputs globally determine inputs, and (3) compound manipulators in which there is no global input or output mapping. Results of differential geometry are used to show that configuration space differentiable manifolds in each category are partitioned into maximal, disjoint, path-connected components in which the manipulator is singularity free and may be effectively controlled. This extends local analytical properties of manipulators that are used for analysis and control to global validity on maximal components of regular manipulator configuration space, providing explicit criteria for avoidance of singular behavior. Model manipulators in each of the three categories are analyzed to illustrate application of the differentiable manifold structure, using only multivariable calculus and linear algebra. Computational methods for forward and inverse kinematics and construction of ordinary differential equations of manipulator dynamics on differentiable manifolds are presented in Part II of this paper, in support of manipulator control.},

However, because of the a priori on the stationarity of the covariance matrix of classic Gaussian Processes, this method may not be adapted for non-stationary functions involved in the optimization problem. To overcome this issue, a new Bayesian Optimization approach is proposed. It is based on Deep Gaussian Processes as surrogate models instead of classic Gaussian Processes. This modeling technique increases the power of representation to capture the non-stationarity by simply considering a functional composition of stationary Gaussian Processes, providing a multiple layer structure. This paper proposes a new algorithm for Global Optimization by coupling Deep Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization. The specificities of this optimization method are discussed and highlighted with academic test cases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on analytical test cases and an aerospace design optimization problem and compared to the state-of-the-art stationary and non-stationary Bayesian Optimization approaches.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8{\texttimes} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

  abstract = {The reinforcement learning paradigm allows, in principle, for complex behaviours to be learned directly from simple reward signals. In practice, however, it is common to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage a particular solution, or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex behavior. Specifically, we train agents in diverse environmental contexts, and find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this principle for locomotion -- behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without explicit reward-based guidance.

We achieve execution robustness through exception handling capabilities that are seamlessly integrated throughout the planning system. Having these recovery mechanisms in place allows us to leverage their capabilities to compensate for problems introduced by approximations made during planning. Turning an apparent problem into an opportunity, we are able to plan complex assembly tasks and execute them robustly without the computational cost associated with more sophisticated planners and apply some of the savings toward recovering from unforeseen run-time errors. We show results where simple planning strategies paired with exception-handling are able to achieve the same outcomes (and in less time) as more elaborate methods would.},

  abstract = {Due to its high potential to perform many tasks faster, more accurately and in greater detail than humans artificial intelligence (AI) has been attracting growing attention across industries. In manufacturing, AI, in combination with digital sensors, networks and software-based automation, defines a new industrialization age. The integration of AI into production processes promises to boost the productivity, efficiency, as well as the automation of processes. However, AI adoption in manufacturing is currently still in its early stage and lacks practical experiences. This raises the question, to which extent manufacturing companies are ready to implement AI. While approaches to assessing the maturity in terms of the digitalization or Industry 4.0 (I4.0) of manufacturing companies are well established and discussed in the literature, approaches that specifically address AI in manufacturing are still lacking. To address this gap, we present an approach to analyze and monitor the readiness of manufacturing firms for working with AI technologies. In accordance with the existing assessment concepts of digitalization and I4.0, our approach examines different areas of digital technologies on the product and production level of manufacturing firms. Moreover, it incorporates the key foundation for AI---security and data---into a conceptual model. We generally assume that companies need to achieve a certain level of digital readiness in three key dimensions in order to be ready for implementing AI-based technologies. We operationalize these dimensions through a variety of product- and production-specific as well as data- and safety-related indicators. In order to illustrate the implementation of our concept in practical terms, we present the results of the readiness assessment of two German manufacturing companies.},

We review the scientific literature published between 2010 and May~2024 to analyze the current state of research on AI in production. Following a systematic approach to select relevant studies, our literature review is based on a sample of articles that contribute to production-specific AI adoption. Our results reveal that the topic has been emerging within the last years and that AI adoption research in production is to date still in an early stage. We are able to systematize and explain 35 factors with a significant role for AI adoption in production and classify the results in a framework. Based on the factor analysis, we establish a future research agenda that serves as a basis for future research and addresses open questions. Our paper provides an overview of the current state of the research on the adoption of AI in a production-specific context, which forms a basis for further studies as well as a starting point for a better understanding of the implementation of AI in practice.},

However, this approach does not apply straightforwardly when the action space is discrete. In this work, we show that it is in fact possible to effectively perform planning via backprop in discrete action spaces, using a simple paramaterization of the actions vectors on the simplex combined with input noise when training the forward model. Our experiments show that this approach can match or outperform model-free RL and discrete planning methods on gridworld navigation tasks in terms of performance and/or planning time while using limited environment interactions, and can additionally be used to perform model-based control in a challenging new task where the action space combines discrete and continuous actions. We furthermore propose a policy distillation approach which yields a fast policy network which can be used at inference time, removing the need for an iterative planning procedure.},

The results are no worse than their ImageNet pre-training counterparts even when using the hyper-parameters of the baseline system (Mask R-CNN) that were optimized for fine-tuning pre-trained models, with the sole exception of increasing the number of training iterations so the randomly initialized models may converge. Training from random initialization is surprisingly robust; our results hold even when: (i) using only 10\% of the training data, (ii) for deeper and wider models, and (iii) for multiple tasks and metrics. Experiments show that ImageNet pre-training speeds up convergence early in training, but does not necessarily provide regularization or improve final target task accuracy. To push the envelope we demonstrate 50.9 AP on COCO object detection without using any external data-a result on par with the top COCO 2017 competition results that used ImageNet pre-training. These observations challenge the conventional wisdom of ImageNet pre-training for dependent tasks and we expect these discoveries will encourage people to rethink the current de facto paradigm of `pretraining and fine-tuning' in computer vision.},

However, using backprop for neural net learning still has some disadvantages, e.g., having to tune a large number of hyperparameters to the data, lack of calibrated probabilistic predictions, and a tendency to overfit the training data. In principle, the Bayesian approach to learning neural networks does not have these problems. However, existing Bayesian techniques lack scalability to large dataset and network sizes. In this work we present a novel scalable method for learning Bayesian neural networks, called probabilistic backpropagation (PBP). Similar to classical backpropagation, PBP works by computing a forward propagation of probabilities through the network and then doing a backward computation of gradients. A series of experiments on ten real-world datasets show that PBP is significantly faster than other techniques, while offering competitive predictive abilities. Our experiments also show that PBP provides accurate estimates of the posterior variance on the network weights.},

  abstract = {An increasing amount of robotic systems is developed for safety-critical scenarios, such as automated cars operating in public road traffic or robots collaborating with humans in flexible manufacturing systems. For this reason, it is important to provide methods that formally verify the safety of robotic systems. This is challenging since robots operate in continuous action spaces in partially unknown environments so that there exists no finite set of scenarios that can be verified before deployment. Verifying the safety during the operation based on the current perception of the environment is often infeasible due to the computational demand of formal verification methods. In this work, we compute sets of behaviors for parameterized motion primitives using reachability analysis, which is used to build a maneuver automaton that connects motion primitives in a safe way. Thus, the computationally expensive task of building a maneuver automaton is performed offline. The proposed analysis method provides the whole set of possible behaviors so that it can be verified whether forbidden state-space regions are avoided during the operation of the robot, to e.g. avoid colliding with obstacles. The method is applied to continuous sets of parameterized motion primitives, making it possible to verify infinitely many motions within the parameter space, which to the best knowledge of the authors has not been published before. The approach is demonstrated for collision avoidance of road vehicles.},

The toolkit is designed (i) to allow non-ASR experts to easily create their own ASR system and run it on iCub and (ii) to build deep learning-based models specifically addressing the main challenges an ASR system faces in the context of verbal human--iCub interactions. The toolkit mostly consists of Python, C++ code and shell scripts integrated in YARP. As additional contribution, a second codebase (written in Matlab) is provided for more expert ASR users who want to experiment with bio-inspired and developmental learning-inspired ASR systems. Specifically, we provide code for two distinct kinds of speech recognition: ``articulatory'' and ``unsupervised'' speech recognition. The first is largely inspired by influential neurobiological theories of speech perception which assume speech perception to be mediated by brain motor cortex activities. Our articulatory systems have been shown to outperform strong deep learning-based baselines. The second type of recognition systems, the ``unsupervised'' systems, do not use any supervised information (contrary to most ASR systems, including our articulatory systems). To some extent, they mimic an infant who has to discover the basic speech units of a language by herself. In addition, we provide resources consisting of pre-trained deep learning models for ASR, and a 2.5-h speech dataset of spoken commands, the VoCub dataset, which can be used to adapt an ASR system to the typical acoustic environments in which iCub operates.},

  abstract = {Exoplanet atmospheric retrieval pairs a radiative transfer (RT) model with a Bayesian framework to infer the atmospheric properties of an exoplanet. This technique's runtime is typically dominated by the RT calculations, which can take seconds per model evaluation depending on model complexity (e.g., spectral resolution, opacity sources, clouds). When executing many retrievals (e.g., to plan for observations or future instruments/telescopes), the computational cost can become significant. Neural networks (NNs) can offer a fast, accurate approximation to a complex process, such as RT, after training on a sufficient data set. By using an NN surrogate model in place of an RT code, retrieval compute costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude. We demonstrate our technique on observations of HD 189733 b. The Bhattacharyya coefficients between the 1D marginalized posteriors of the NN-accelerated retrieval and the Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (BART) code are {$>$}0.9647, with a mean of 0.9905. We find a reduction in forward model compute time by a factor of {\textasciitilde}20 per parallel chain when using an Intel i7-4770 central processing unit (CPU). By utilizing an Nvidia Titan Xp graphics processing unit, forward model compute time is reduced by a factor of {\textasciitilde}275 per chain compared to that CPU. Our open-source implementation can be readily applied to other problems beyond exoplanet retrieval.

  abstract = {Most learning algorithms require the practitioner to manually set the values of many hyperparameters before the learning process can begin. However, with modern algorithms, the evaluation of a given hyperparameter setting can take a considerable amount of time and the search space is often very high-dimensional. We suggest using a lower-dimensional representation of the original data to quickly identify promising areas in the hyperparameter space. This information can then be used to initialize the optimization algorithm for the original, higher-dimensional data. We compare this approach with the standard procedure of optimizing the hyperparameters only on the original input. We perform experiments with various state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms such as random search, the tree of parzen estimators (TPEs), sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC), and a genetic algorithm (GA). Our experiments indicate that it is possible to speed up the optimization process by using lower-...},

Neuro-Symbolic AI has a long history, however it remained a rather niche topic until recently, when landmark advances in machine learning -- prompted by deep learning -- caused a significant rise in interest and research activity in combining neural and symbolic methods. In this overview, we provide a rough guide to key research directions, and literature pointers for anybody interested in learning more about the field.}

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}

  abstract = {Due to their advantages, there is an increase of applying robotic systems for small batch production as well as for complex manufacturing processes. However, programming and configuring robots is time and resource consuming while being also accompanied by high costs that are especially challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The current way of programming industrial robots by using teach-in control devices and/or using vendor-specific programming languages is in general a complex activity that requires extensive knowledge in the robotics domain. It is therefore important to offer new practical methods for the programming of industrial robots that provide flexibility and versatility in order to achieve feasible robotics solutions for small lot size productions. This paper focuses on the development of a knowledge-driven framework, which should overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art robotics solutions and enhance the agility and autonomy of industrial robotics systems using ontologies as a knowledge-source. The framework includes reasoning and perception abilities as well as the ability to generate plans, select appropriate actions, and finally execute these actions. In this context, a challenge is the fusion of vision system information with the decision-making component, which can use this information for generating the assembly tasks and executable programs. The introduced product model in the form of an ontology enables that the framework can semantically link perception data to product models to consequently derive handling operations and required tools. Besides, the framework enables an easier adaption of robot-based production systems for individualized production, which requires swift configuration and efficient planning. The presented approach is demonstrated in a laboratory environment with an industrial pilot test case. Our application shows the potential to reduce the efforts needed to program robots in an automated production environment. In this context, the benefits as well as shortcomings of the approach are also discussed in the paper.},

Working on the assumption that this ``student'' is you -- the readers in earlier stages of their careers -- I herein aim to answer three questions that you surely desired to ask back then already: What is it good for? Does it work? Is it interesting to do research in? Answering the latter two questions in the affirmative (of course!), I outline some of the major developments of the last decade, revolutionizing the ability of planning to scale up, and the understanding of the enabling technology. Answering the first question, I point out that modern planning proves to be quite useful for solving practical problems - including, perhaps, yours.},

We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5\% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7\% improvement over Gopher.},

The algorithm analyzes this semantic information to determine which portion of the input plans accomplishes a particular task and constructs task-reduction methods based on those analyses. We present theoretical results showing that HTN-MAKER is sound and complete. Our experiments in five well-known planning domains confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate convergence toward a set of HTN methods that can be used to solve any problem expressible as a classical planning problem in that domain, relative to a set of goal types for which tasks have been defined. In three of the five domains, HTN planning with the learned methods scales much better than a modern classical planner.},

With simulation, data to train a policy can be collected efficiently at scale, but the visual gap between sim and real makes deployment in the real world difficult. We introduce RetinaGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to adapt simulated images to realistic ones with object-detection consistency. RetinaGAN is trained in an unsupervised manner without task loss dependencies, and preserves general object structure and texture in adapted images. We evaluate our method on three real world tasks: grasping, pushing, and door opening. RetinaGAN improves upon the performance of prior sim-to-real methods for RL-based object instance grasping and continues to be effective even in the limited data regime. When applied to a pushing task in a similar visual domain, RetinaGAN demonstrates transfer with no additional real data requirements. We also show our method bridges the visual gap for a novel door opening task using imitation learning in a new visual domain. Visit the project website at https://retinagan.github.io/},

  abstract = {Despite its high potential for increasing efficiency, productivity and automation, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in production is still at a very early stage and lacks practical experience, particularly in the small and medium sized enterprise segment. One of the main reasons for that is the lack of knowledge on how ready the companies are for adopting and using AI effectively. While approaches to assessing readiness and even maturity in terms of digitalization or Industry 4.0 are well established and discussed in the literature and used actively in companies' practice, approaches that address AI are still in their infancy. Addressing this gap, this paper presents a qualitative approach to an in-depth analysis and monitoring of the readiness of manufacturing firms for working with AI. Drawing on the literature on technology adoption on the one hand, and the implementation of AI on the other, we develop an integrative framework covering different socio-technical dimensions. For their operationalization, we use a large range of technical, organizational and environmental categories. In order to illustrate the implementation of our approach in practical terms, we present the results of assessing the AI readiness of a German manufacturing company.},

That is, rather than training a controller network and placing this network directly in the feedback or feedforward paths, the forward model of the plant is learned, and iterative inversion is performed on line to generate control commands. The control approach allows the controllers to respond online to changes in the plant dynamics. This approach also attempts to avoid the difficulty of analysis introduced by most current neural network controllers, which place the highly nonlinear neural network directly in the feedback path. A neural network-based model reference adaptive controller is also proposed for systems having significant dynamics between the control inputs and the observed (or desired) outputs and is demonstrated on a simple linear control system. These results are interpreted in terms of the need for a dither signal for on-line identification of dynamic systems.{$<>$}},

Contrary to conventional approaches to AI where a given task is solved from scratch using a fixed learning algorithm, meta-learning aims to improve the learning algorithm itself, given the experience of multiple learning episodes. This paradigm provides an opportunity to tackle many of the conventional challenges of deep learning, including data and computation bottlenecks, as well as the fundamental issue of generalization. In this survey we describe the contemporary meta-learning landscape. We first discuss definitions of meta-learning and position it with respect to related fields, such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, and hyperparameter optimization. We then propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of meta-learning methods today. We survey promising applications and successes of meta-learning including few-shot learning, reinforcement learning and architecture search. Finally, we discuss outstanding challenges and promising areas for future research.},

The system is designed to let non-roboticists and roboticists alike program end-to-end manipulation tasks. To accomplish this, Code3 provides three integrated components for perception, manipulation, and high-level programming. The perception component helps users define a library of object and scene parts that the robot can later detect. The manipulation component lets users define actions for manipulating objects or scene parts through programming by demonstration. Finally, the high-level programming component provides a drag-and-drop interface with which users can program the logic and control flow to accomplish a task using their previously specified perception and manipulation capabilities. We present findings from an observational user study with non-roboticist programmers (N=10) that demonstrate their ability to quickly learn Code3 and program a PR2 robot to do manipulation tasks. We also demonstrate how the system is expressive enough for an expert to rapidly program highly complex manipulation tasks like playing tic-tac-toe and reconfiguring an object to be graspable.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning has been studied widely as a convenient way to transfer human skills to robots. This learning approach is aimed at extracting relevant motion patterns from human demonstrations and subsequently applying these patterns to different situations. Despite the many advancements that have been achieved, solutions for coping with unpredicted situations (e.g., obstacles and external perturbations) and high-dimensional inputs are still largely absent. In this paper, we propose a novel kernelized movement primitive (KMP), which allows the robot to adapt the learned motor skills and fulfill a variety of additional constraints arising over the course of a task. Specifically, KMP is capable of learning trajectories associated with high-dimensional inputs owing to the kernel treatment, which in turn renders a model with fewer open parameters in contrast to methods that rely on basis functions. Moreover, we extend our approach by exploiting local trajectory representations in different coordinate systems that describe the task at hand, endowing KMP with reliable extrapolation capabilities in broader domains. We apply KMP to the learning of time-driven trajectories as a special case, where a compact parametric representation describing a trajectory and its first-order derivative is utilized. In order to verify the effectiveness of our method, several examples of trajectory modulations and extrapolations associated with time inputs, as well as trajectory adaptations with high-dimensional inputs are provided.},

While this is useful for matching images to natural language descriptions of object goals, it remains disjoint from the process of mapping the environment, so that it lacks the spatial precision of classic geometric maps. To address this problem, we propose VLMaps, a spatial map representation that directly fuses pretrained visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical world. VLMaps can be autonomously built from video feed on robots using standard exploration approaches and enables natural language indexing of the map without additional labeled data. Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence of open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial by construction, e.g., ``in between the sofa and the TV'' or ``three meters to the right of the chair'') directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared among multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps on-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories). Extensive experiments carried out in simulated and real-world environments show that VLMaps enable navigation according to more complex language instructions than existing methods.

Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is {\textbackslash}textit\{superposition\}, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task {\textbackslash}citep\{wang2022interpretability\} to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method.

  abstract = {Physical simulators have been widely used in robot planning and control. Among them, differentiable simulators are particularly favored, as they can be incorporated into gradient-based optimization algorithms that are efficient in solving inverse problems such as optimal control and motion planning. Therefore, rigid body simulators and recently their differentiable variants are studied extensively. Simulating deformable objects is, however, more challenging compared to rigid body dynamics. The underlying physical laws of deformable objects are more complex, and the resulting systems have orders of magnitude more degrees of freedom and there-fore they are significantly more computationally expensive to simulate. Computing gradients with respect to physical design or controller parameters is typically even more computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose a real-time, differentiable hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian physical simulator for deformable objects, ChainQueen, based on the Moving Least Squares Material Point Method (MLS-MPM). MLS-MPM can simulate deformable objects with collisions and can be seamlessly incorporated into soft robotic systems. We demonstrate that our simulator achieves high precision in both forward simulation and backward gradient computation. We have successfully employed it in a diverse set of inference, control and co-design tasks for soft robotics.},

  abstract = {This work presents dense stereo reconstruction using high-resolution images for infrastructure inspections. The state-of-the-art stereo reconstruction methods, both learning and non-learning ones, consume too much computational resource on high-resolution data. Recent learning-based methods achieve top ranks on most benchmarks. However, they suffer from the generalization issue due to lack of task-specific training data. We propose to use a less resource demanding non-learning method, guided by a learning-based model, to handle high-resolution images and achieve accurate stereo reconstruction. The deep-learning model produces an initial disparity prediction with uncertainty for each pixel of the down-sampled stereo image pair. The uncertainty serves as a self-measurement of its generalization ability and the perpixel searching range around the initially predicted disparity. The downstream process performs a modified version of the Semi-Global Block Matching method with the up-sampled perpixel searching range. The proposed deep-learning assisted method is evaluated on the Middlebury dataset and high-resolution stereo images collected by our customized binocular stereo camera. The combination of learning and non-learning methods achieves better performance on 12 out of 15 cases of the Middlebury dataset. In our infrastructure inspection experiments, the average 3D reconstruction error is less than 0.004m.},

  abstract = {Building general-purpose robots that can operate seamlessly, in any environment, with any object, and utilizing various skills to complete diverse tasks has been a long-standing goal in Artificial Intelligence. Unfortunately, however, most existing robotic systems have been constrained - having been designed for specific tasks, trained on specific datasets, and deployed within specific environments. These systems usually require extensively-labeled data, rely on task-specific models, have numerous generalization issues when deployed in real-world scenarios, and struggle to remain robust to distribution shifts. Motivated by the impressive open-set performance and content generation capabilities of web-scale, large-capacity pre-trained models (i.e., foundation models) in research fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), we devote this survey to exploring (i) how these existing foundation models from NLP and CV can be applied to the field of robotics, and also exploring (ii) what a robotics-specific foundation model would look like. We begin by providing an overview of what constitutes a conventional robotic system and the fundamental barriers to making it universally applicable. Next, we establish a taxonomy to discuss current work exploring ways to leverage existing foundation models for robotics and develop ones catered to robotics. Finally, we discuss key challenges and promising future directions in using foundation models for enabling general-purpose robotic systems. We encourage readers to view our living GitHub repository of resources, including papers reviewed in this survey as well as related projects and repositories for developing foundation models for robotics.},

  abstract = {Despite significant advances in few-shot classification, object detection, or speech recognition in recent years, training an effective robot to adapt to previously unseen environments in a small data regime is still a long-lasting problem for learning from demonstrations (LfD). A promising solution is meta-learning. However, we notice that simply constructing a model with a more complicated and deeper network via previous meta-learning methods does not perform well as we expected. One possible reason is that the shallow features are gradually lost as the network deepens, while these shallow features play an essential role in the adaptation process of meta-learning. Thus, we present a novel yet effective Multi-Level and Multi-Attention Domain-Adaptive Domain-Adaptive Meta-Learning (MLMA-DAML) framework, which meta-learns multiple visual features via different attention heads to update the model policy. Once the model is updated, our MLMA-DAML predicts robot actions (e.g., positions of end-effectors) via fully connected layers (FCL). As we notice that directly converting visual signals to robot actions via FCL following prior methods is not robust to perform robot manipulation tasks, we further extend our MLMA-DAML to MLMA-DAML++. The proposed MLMA-DAML++ learns an effective representation of manipulation tasks via an extra goal prediction network with convolutional layers (CL) to predict more reliable robot actions (represented by feature pixels/grids). Extensive experiments on a UR5 robot arm demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly outperform current related state-of-the-art methods in different real-world placing settings.},

Motivated by these concerns, there have been calls for the verification of systems of AI, including their explanation. Nevertheless, tools for the verification of systems of AI are complex, and so error-prone. This paper describes one initial effort towards the certification of logic-based explainability algorithms, focusing on monotonic classifiers. Concretely, the paper starts by using the proof assistant Coq to prove the correctness of recently proposed algorithms for explaining monotonic classifiers. Then, the paper proves that the algorithms devised for monotonic classifiers can be applied to the larger family of stable classifiers. Finally, confidence code, extracted from the proofs of correctness, is used for computing explanations that are guaranteed to be correct. The experimental results included in the paper show the scalability of the proposed approach for certifying explanations.},

  abstract = {The extensive effort in manual labour for mould manufacturing is the main reason for outsourcing manufacturing resources to low-wage countries. Furthermore, the international mould and die sector faces a lack of skilled workers due to the unattractive working conditions, for example the stressing, monotonous work and a partly hazardous working atmosphere (e.g. nickel dust). Especially, the finishing process (e.g. grinding, lapping, polishing) of freeform surfaces is still less automated in metal processing. Therefore, many efforts are initiated in order to fully automate the finishing process, but the today's approaches are usually limited on prototypal implemented and cost-intensive machine solutions. This work introduces a finishing control approach for freeform surfaces using a lightweight robot. The robot is used as an actuator as well as a sensor for closed-loop force control. The optimal force trajectory is determined by a CAD-model which describes the geometry of the workpiece. The noisy measured force signal is filtered by a Kalman filter which also estimates the system state for the model predictive controller (MPC). Finally, a simple position controller controls the position of the tool center point (TCP) and the MPC controls the force which occur on the tool. The results show that the force can be controlled with a higher accuracy than with a conventional impedance control, which is commercially provided.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning techniques aim to mimic human behavior in a given task. An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.},

This paper presents a detailed analysis of six functions for measuring distance between 3D rotations that have been proposed in the literature. Based on the well-developed theory behind 3D rotations, we demonstrate that five of them are bi-invariant metrics on SO(3) but that only four of them are boundedly equivalent to each other. We conclude that it is both spatially and computationally more efficient to use quaternions for 3D rotations. Lastly, by treating the two rotations as a true and an estimated rotation matrix, we illustrate the geometry associated with iso-error measures.},

  abstract = {Neural Networks have long been applied to inverse problems solving. The literature documents a development from the use of neural networks as explicit inverses, to Neural Network Iterative Inversion (NNII), and nally to Bayesian Neural Network Iterative Inversion (BNNII), which adds a Bayesian superstructure to NNII. Inverse problems have been often considered ill-posed, i.e., the statement of the problem does not thoroughly constrain the solution space. BNNII takes advantage of this lack of information by adding additional informative constraints to the problem solution using Bayesian methodology. Inverse problems in remote sensing applications a ord opportunities for inclusion of prior probabilities, noise distributions, ground truth information, smoothness constraints, and other informative constraints within a Bayesian probabilistic framework. This paper reviews some of these techniques and shows how ground truth information and/or information regarding the particular parameter contour under reconstruction, and information regarding the underlying physical process, can be e ectively added to the problem solution, and thus provides a signi cant performance improvement.},

  abstract = {Purpose:~           Anastomotic leaks are among the most dreaded complications after colorectal surgery. However, problems with definitions and the retrospective nature of previous analyses have been major limitations. We sought to use a prospective database to define the true incidence and presentation of anastomotic leakage after intestinal anastomosis.           Methods:~           A prospective database of two colorectal surgeons was reviewed over a 10-year period (1995--2004). The incidence of leak by surgical site, timing of diagnosis, method of detection, and treatment was noted. Complications were entered prospectively by a nurse practitioner directly involved in patient care. Standardized criteria for diagnosis were used. A logistic regression model was used to discriminate statistical variation.           Results:~           A total of 1223 patients underwent resection and anastomosis during the study period. Mean age was 59.1 years. Leaks occurred in 33 patients (2.7\%). Diagnosis was made a mean of 12.7 days postoperatively, including four beyond 30 days (12.1\%). There was no difference in leak rate by surgeon (3.6\% vs. 2.2\%; P = 0.08). The leak rate was similar by surgical site except for a markedly increased leak rate with ileorectal anastomosis (P = 0.001). Twelve leaks were diagnosed clinically versus 21 radiographically. Contrast enema correctly identified only 4 of 10 leaks, whereas CT correctly identified 17 of 19. A total of 14 of 33 (42\%) patients had their leak diagnosed only after readmission. Fifteen patients required fecal diversion, whereas 18 could be managed nonoperatively.           Conclusions:~           Anastomotic leaks are frequently diagnosed late in the postoperative period and often after initial hospital discharge, highlighting the importance of prospective data entry and adequate follow-up. CT scan is the preferred diagnostic modality when imaging is required. More than half of leaks can be managed without fecal diversion.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomously acquiring complex behaviors from low level sensor observations. Although a large portion of deep RL research has focused on applications in video games and simulated control, which does not connect with the constraints of learning in real environments, deep RL has also demonstrated promise in enabling physical robots to learn complex skills in the real world. At the same time,real world robotics provides an appealing domain for evaluating such algorithms, as it connects directly to how humans learn; as an embodied agent in the real world. Learning to perceive and move in the real world presents numerous challenges, some of which are easier to address than others, and some of which are often not considered in RL research that focuses only on simulated domains. In this review article, we present a number of case studies involving robotic deep RL. Building off of these case studies, we discuss commonly perceived challenges in deep RL and how they have been addressed in these works. We also provide an overview of other outstanding challenges, many of which are unique to the real-world robotics setting and are not often the focus of mainstream RL research. Our goal is to provide a resource both for roboticists and machine learning researchers who are interested in furthering the progress of deep RL in the real world.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

At the same time, machine learning models are becoming increasingly sophisticated and exhibit many features often seen in scientific computing, stressing the capabilities of machine learning frameworks. Just as the disciplines of scientific computing and machine learning have shared common underlying infrastructure in the form of numerical linear algebra, we now have the opportunity to further share new computational infrastructure, and thus ideas, in the form of Differentiable Programming. We describe Zygote, a Differentiable Programming system that is able to take gradients of general program structures. We implement this system in the Julia programming language. Our system supports almost all language constructs (control flow, recursion, mutation, etc.) and compiles high-performance code without requiring any user intervention or refactoring to stage computations. This enables an expressive programming model for deep learning, but more importantly, it enables us to incorporate a large ecosystem of libraries in our models in a straightforward way. We discuss our approach to automatic differentiation, including its support for advanced techniques such as mixed-mode, complex and checkpointed differentiation, and present several examples of differentiating programs.},

  abstract = {A framework named Flux is presented that shows how further refinement of the core ideas of machine learning, built upon the foundation of the Julia programming language, can yield an environment that is simple, easily modifiable, and performant. Machine learning as a discipline has seen an incredible surge of interest in recent years due in large part to a perfect storm of new theory, superior tooling, renewed interest in its capabilities. We present in this paper a framework named Flux that shows how further refinement of the core ideas of machine learning, built upon the foundation of the Julia programming language, can yield an environment that is simple, easily modifiable, and performant. We detail the fundamental principles of Flux as a framework for differentiable programming, give examples of models that are implemented within Flux to display many of the language and framework-level features that contribute to its ease of use and high productivity, display internal compiler techniques used to enable the acceleration and performance that lies at the heart of Flux, and finally give an overview of the larger ecosystem that Flux fits inside of.}

Our method does not require a pre-defined shape template to start with and builds up the scene model from scratch during the scanning process. Geometry and motion are parameterized in a unified manner by a volumetric representation that encodes a distance field of the surface geometry as well as the non-rigid space deformation. Motion tracking is based on a set of extracted sparse color features in combination with a dense depth-based constraint formulation. This enables accurate tracking and drastically reduces drift inherent to standard model-to-depth alignment. We cast finding the optimal deformation of space as a non-linear regularized variational optimization problem by enforcing local smoothness and proximity to the input constraints. The problem is tackled in real-time at the camera's capture rate using a data-parallel flip-flop optimization strategy. Our results demonstrate robust tracking even for fast motion and scenes that lack geometric features.},

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

The framework targets human programmable interfaces (HPIs), which can be used by people with little or no programming experience. The framework follows a meta-programming approach by enabling users to program cobots by voice in addition to using a mouse, tablet or keyboard. Upon a voice instruction (such as move, pick, release, etc.), the framework automates the manual tasks required to manipulate the vendor-provided HPI. The main advantages of this approach are simplified, guided programming, which only requires the knowledge of 5--10 voice instructions; increased programming speed by up to 46\% compared to the manual approach; and the possibility of sharing programs as videos. The open-source framework was evaluated using two application scenarios.},

  abstract = {Popularized by the long short-term memory (LSTM), multiplicative gates have become a standard means to design artificial neural networks with intentionally organized information flow. Notable examples of such architectures include gated recurrent units (GRU) and highway networks. In this work, we first focus on the evaluation of each of the classical gated architectures for language modeling for large vocabulary speech recognition. Namely, we evaluate the highway network, lateral network, LSTM and GRU. Furthermore, the motivation underlying the highway network also applies to LSTM and GRU. An extension specific to the LSTM has been recently proposed with an additional highway connection between the memory cells of adjacent LSTM layers. In contrast, we investigate an approach which can be used with both LSTM and GRU: a highway network in which the LSTM or GRU is used as the transformation function. We found that the highway connections enable both standalone feedforward and recurrent neural language models to benefit better from the deep structure and provide a slight improvement of recognition accuracy after interpolation with count models. To complete the overview, we include our initial investigations on the use of the attention mechanism for learning word triggers.},

The skills  are reusable items providing motion control and rich declarative descriptions  of complex robot capabilities. Storing the skills requires an adequate knowledge  representation model that enables reuse and reasoning on skills and simplifies  knowledge management. In this thesis we develop a skill representation  model and implement it in the LTH knowledge base. It was developed by  studying, normalizing, extending and modularizing the current skill concepts  in the LTH knowledge base. The developed model is effectively a class hierarchy  of the skill concepts implemented in a modularized ontology structure.  The resulting model clarifies the intrinsic concepts of a skill and presents a  module structure that enables the future development and reuse of skills in  general.},

Motion planning, logic-based planning and probabilistic mission planning are integrated into a single system and planning models are generated using Programming by [human] Demonstration (PbD). The strength of planning models arises from the flexibility they give the robot in dealing with changing scenes and highly varying sequences of events. This comes at the cost of complex planning model representations and generation, however. Manually engineering very general descriptions covering a large sets of challenges is infeasible as is learning them exclusively by robot self-exploration. Thus, we present PbD for planning models together with generation of parameters from analysis of geometric scene properties to tackle that difficulty. Experimental results show the applicability of these techniques on natural learning and autonomous execution of complex robot manipulation challenges.},

Such uncertainty can cause a significant delay, extra energy expenditure, and may even results in detriments to the mated parts or the robot itself. This article suggests a strategy for identifying the accurate hole position in force-guided robotic peg-in-hole assembly tasks through employing only the captured wrench (the Cartesian forces and torques) signals of the manipulated. In the framework of using the Contact-State (CS) modeling for such robotic tasks, the identification of the hole position is realized through detecting the CS that corresponds for the phase of the peg-on-hole, that is the phase in which the peg is located precisely on the hole. Expectation Maximization-based Gaussian Mixtures Model (EM-GMM) CS modeling scheme is employed in detecting the CS corresponding for the peg-on-hole phase. Only the wrench signals are used in modeling and detecting the phases of the assembly process. The considered peg-in-hole assembly process starts from free space and as soon as the peg touches the environment with missing the hole, a spiral search path is followed that would survey the whole environment surface. When the CS of the peg-on-hole is detected, the hole position is identified. Experiments are conducted on a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing typical peg-in-hole assembly tasks. Multiple hole positions are considered and excellent performance of the proposed identification strategy is shown.},

  abstract = {A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to build rich mental models of previously unseen objects from very few interactions. To achieve true, continuous autonomy, robots too must possess this ability. Importantly, to integrate with the probabilistic robotics software stack, such models must encapsulate the uncertainty (resulting from noisy dynamics and observation models) in a prescriptive manner. We present Bayesian Object Models (BOMs): generative (probabilistic) models that encode both the structural and kinodynamic attributes of an object. BOMs are implemented in the form of a differentiable probabilistic program that models latent scene structure, object dynamics, and observation models. This allows for efficient and automated Bayesian inference -- samples (object trajectories) drawn from the BOM are compared with a small set of real-world observations and used to compute a likelihood function. Our model comprises a differentiable tree structure sampler and a differentiable physics engine, enabling gradient computation through this likelihood function. This enables gradient-based Bayesian inference to efficiently update the distributional parameters of our model. BOMs outperform several recent approaches, including differentiable physics-based, gradient-free, and neural inference schemes. Further information at: https://bayesianobjects.github.io/},

  abstract = {Grasping requires coding of the object's intrinsic properties (size and shape), and the transformation of these properties into a pattern of distal (finger and wrist) movements. Computational models address this behavior through the interaction of perceptual and motor schemas. In monkeys, the transformation of an object's intrinsic properties into specific grips takes place in a circuit that is formed by the inferior parietal lobule and the inferior premotor area (area F5). Neurons in both these areas code size, shape and orientation of objects, and specific types of grip that are necessary to grasp them. Grasping movements are coded more globally in the inferior parietal lobule, whereas they are more segmented in area F5. In humans, neuropsychological studies of patients with lesions to the parietal lobule confirm that primitive shape characteristics of an object for grasping are analyzed in the parietal lobe, and also demonstrate that this 'pragmatic' analysis of objects is separated from the 'semantic' analysis performed in the temporal lobe.},

  abstract = {Using a model in which agents compete to develop a potentially dangerous new technology (AI), we study how changes in the pricing of factors of production (computational resources) affect agents' strategies, particularly their spending on safety meant to reduce the danger from the new technology. In the model, agents split spending between safety and performance, with safety determining the probability of a ``disaster" outcome, and performance determining the agents' competitiveness relative to their peers. For given parameterizations, we determine the theoretically optimal spending strategies by numerically computing Nash equilibria. Using this approach we find that (1) in symmetric scenarios, compute price increases are safety-promoting if and only if the production of performance scales faster than the production of safety; (2) the probability of a disaster can be made arbitrarily low by providing a sufficiently large subsidy to a single agent; (3) when agents differ in productivity, providing a subsidy to the more productive agent is often better for aggregate safety than providing the same subsidy to other agent(s) (with some qualifications, which we discuss); (4) when one agent is much more safety-conscious, in the sense of believing that safety is more difficult to achieve, relative to his competitors, subsidizing that agent is typically better for aggregate safety than subsidizing its competitors; however, subsidizing an agent that is only somewhat more safety-conscious often decreases safety. Thus, although subsidizing a much more safety-conscious, or productive, agent often improves safety as intuition suggests, subsidizing a somewhat more safety-conscious or productive agent can often be harmful.},

Due to the hardware improvements such as high definition cameras, this procedure has significantly improved and new software methods have open potential for computer-assisted procedures. However, there exists challenges and requirement to improve detection and tracking of the position of the instruments during these surgical procedures. To this end, we evaluate and compare some popular deep learning methods that can potentially be explored for the automated segmentation of surgical instruments in laparoscopy, an important step towards tool tracking. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Dual decoder attention network (DDANet) produces a superior result compared to other recent deep learning methods. DDANet produces a dice coefficient of 0.8739 and mean intersection over union of 0.8183 for the Robust Medical Instrument Segmentation (ROBUST-MIS) Challenge 2019 dataset, at a real-time speed of 101.36 frames per second which is critical for such procedures.},

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in the real-world environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior performance in comparison to baseline methods.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind farms will play a vital role in the global ambition of net zero energy generation. Future offshore wind farms will be larger and further from the coast, meaning that traditional human-based operations and maintenance approaches will become infeasible due to safety, cost, and skills shortages. The use of remotely operated or autonomous robotic assistants to undertake these activities provides an attractive alternative solution. This paper presents an autonomous multirobot system which is able to transport, deploy and retrieve a wind turbine blade inspection robot using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed solution is a fully autonomous system including a robot deployment interface for deployment, a mechatronic link-hook module (LHM) for retrieval, both installed on the underside of a UAV, a mechatronic on-load attaching module installed on the robotic payload and an intelligent global mission planner. The LHM is integrated with a 2-DOF hinge that can operate either passively or actively to reduce the swing motion of a slung load by approximately 30\%. The mechatronic modules can be coupled and decoupled by special maneuvers of the UAV, and the intelligent global mission planner coordinates the operations of the UAV and the mechatronic modules for synchronous and seamless actions. For navigation in the vicinity of wind turbine blades, a visual-based localization merged with the location knowledge from Global Navigation Satellite System has been developed. A proof-of-concept system was field tested on a full-size decommissioned wind-turbine blade. The results show that the experimental system is able to deploy and retrieve a robotic payload onto and from a wind turbine blade safely and robustly without the need for human intervention. The vicinity localization and navigation system have shown an accuracy of 0.65 and 0.44 m in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Furthermore, this study shows the feasibility of systems toward autonomous inspection and maintenance of offshore windfarms.},

The ability to perceive transparent objects enables robots to achieve higher levels of autonomy, unlocking new applications in various industries such as healthcare, services and manufacturing. Despite numerous datasets and perception methods being proposed in recent years, there is still a lack of in-depth understanding of these methods and the challenges in this field. To address this gap, this article provides a comprehensive survey of the platforms and recent advances for robotic perception of transparent objects. We highlight the main challenges and propose future directions of various transparent object perception tasks, i.e., segmentation, reconstruction, and pose estimation. We also discuss the limitations of existing datasets in diversity and complexity, and the benefits of employing multi-modal sensors, such as RGB-D cameras, thermal cameras, and polarised imaging, for transparent object perception. Furthermore, we identify perception challenges in complex and dynamic environments, as well as for objects with changeable geometries.

A task-motion plan for a mobile service robot that behaves in a highly dynamic domain can be sensitive to domain uncertainty and changes, leading to suboptimal behaviors or execution failures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TMP-RL, which is an integration of TMP and reinforcement learning (RL), to solve the problem of robust TMP in dynamic and uncertain domains. The robot first generates a low-cost, feasible task-motion plan by iteratively planning in the discrete space and updating relevant action costs evaluated by the motion planner in continuous space. During execution, the robot learns via model-free RL to further improve its task-motion plans. RL enables adaptability to the current domain, but can be costly with regards to experience; using TMP, which does not rely on experience, can jump-start the learning process before executing in the real world. TMP-RL is evaluated in a mobile service robot domain where the robot navigates in an office area, showing significantly improved adaptability to unseen domain dynamics over TMP and task planning (TP)-RL methods.},

Off-the-shelf task planners can be used by intelligent robotics practitioners to solve a variety of planning problems. However, many different planners exist, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and there are no general rules for which planner would be best to apply to a given problem. In this study, we empirically compare the performance of state-of-the-art planners that use either the planning domain description language (PDDL) or answer set programming (ASP) as the underlying action language. PDDL is designed for task planning, and PDDL-based planners are widely used for a variety of planning problems. ASP is designed for knowledge-intensive reasoning, but can also be used to solve task planning problems. Given domain encodings that are as similar as possible, we find that PDDL-based planners perform better on problems with longer solutions, and ASP-based planners are better on tasks with a large number of objects or tasks in which complex reasoning is required to reason about action preconditions and effects. The resulting analysis can inform selection among general-purpose planning systems for particular robot task planning domains.},

We investigate three learning modes of the PDP: inverse reinforcement learning,  system identification, and  control/planning. We demonstrate the capability of the PDP in each learning mode on different high-dimensional systems, including multilink robot arm,  6-DoF maneuvering UAV, and 6-DoF rocket powered landing.}

In the spirit of interior-point methods, Safe PDP handles different types of system constraints on states and inputs by incorporating them into the cost or loss through barrier functions. We prove three fundamentals of the proposed Safe PDP: first, both the solution and its gradient in the backward pass can be approximated by solving their more efficient unconstrained counterparts; second, the approximation for both the solution and its gradient can be controlled for arbitrary accuracy by a barrier parameter; and third, importantly, all intermediate results throughout the approximation and optimization strictly respect the constraints, thus guaranteeing safety throughout the entire learning and control process. We demonstrate the capabilities of Safe PDP in solving various safety-critical tasks, including safe policy optimization, safe motion planning, and learning MPCs from demonstrations, on different challenging systems such as 6-DoF maneuvering quadrotor and 6-DoF rocket powered landing.},

Our method models imitation learning as a state estimation problem, with the state defined as the end-effector's pose at the point where object interaction begins, as observed from the demonstration. By modelling a manipulation task as a coarse, approach trajectory followed by a fine, interaction trajectory, this state estimator can be trained in a self-supervised manner, by automatically moving the end-effector's camera around the object. At test time, the end-effector is moved to the estimated state through a linear path, at which point the demonstration's end-effector velocities are simply repeated, enabling convenient acquisition of a complex interaction trajectory without actually needing to explicitly learn a policy. Real-world experiments on 8 everyday tasks show that our method can learn a diverse range of skills from just a single human demonstration, whilst also yielding a stable and interpretable controller.},

Although research on grounding has a long tradition, the paradigm shift caused by LLMs has brought the concept onto the foreground, in particular in the context of cognitive robotics. To avoid generation of irrelevant or false information, the system needs to ground its utterances into real-world events, and to avoid the statistical parrot effect, the system needs to construct shared understanding of the dialogue context and of the partner's intents. Grounding and construction of the shared context enables cooperation between the participants, and thus supports trustworthy interaction. This paper discusses grounding using neural LLM technology. It aims to bridge neural and symbolic computing on the cognitive architecture level, so as to contribute to a better understanding of how conversational reasoning and collaboration can be linked to LLM implementations to support trustworthy and flexible interaction.}

In particular, we demonstrate how to adapt vision-based robotic manipulation policies to new variations by fine-tuning via off-policy reinforcement learning, including changes in background, object shape and appearance, lighting conditions, and robot morphology. Further, this adaptation uses less than 0.2\% of the data necessary to learn the task from scratch. We find that our approach of adapting pre-trained policies leads to substantial performance gains over the course of fine-tuning, and that pre-training via RL is essential: training from scratch or adapting from supervised ImageNet features are both unsuccessful with such small amounts of data. We also find that these positive results hold in a limited continual learning setting, in which we repeatedly fine-tune a single lineage of policies using data from a succession of new tasks. Our empirical conclusions are consistently supported by experiments on simulated manipulation tasks, and by 52 unique fine-tuning experiments on a real robotic grasping system pre-trained on 580,000 grasps.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

We train Shap-E in two stages: first, we train an encoder that deterministically maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function; second, we train a conditional diffusion model on outputs of the encoder. When trained on a large dataset of paired 3D and text data, our resulting models are capable of generating complex and diverse 3D assets in a matter of seconds. When compared to Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds, Shap-E converges faster and reaches comparable or better sample quality despite modeling a higher-dimensional, multi-representation output space.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a method (Action-Fusion) for human action recognition from depth maps and posture data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Two input descriptors are used for action representation. The first input is a depth motion image that accumulates consecutive depth maps of a human action, whilst the second input is a proposed moving joints descriptor which represents the motion of body joints over time. In order to maximize feature extraction for accurate action classification, three CNN channels are trained with different inputs. The first channel is trained with depth motion images (DMIs), the second channel is trained with both DMIs and moving joint descriptors together, and the third channel is trained with moving joint descriptors only. The action predictions generated from the three CNN channels are fused together for the final action classification. We propose several fusion score operations to maximize the score of the right action. The experiments show that the results of fusing the output of three channels are better than using one channel or fusing two channels only. Our proposed method was evaluated on three public datasets: 1) Microsoft action 3-D dataset (MSRAction3D); 2) University of Texas at Dallas-multimodal human action dataset; and 3) multimodal action dataset (MAD) dataset. The testing results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms most of existing state-of-the-art methods, such as histogram of oriented 4-D normals and Actionlet on MSRAction3D. Although MAD dataset contains a high number of actions (35 actions) compared to existing action RGB-D datasets, this paper surpasses a state-of-the-art method on the dataset by 6.84\%.},

The successes in these problems has led researchers to consider the possibilities for intelligent systems to tackle a problem that humans have only recently themselves considered: program synthesis. This challenge is unlike others such as object recognition and speech translation, since its abstract nature and demand for rigor make it difficult even for human minds to attempt. While it is still far from being solved or even competitive with most existing methods, neural program synthesis is a rapidly growing discipline which holds great promise if completely realized. In this paper, we start with exploring the problem statement and challenges of program synthesis. Then, we examine the fascinating evolution of program induction models, along with how they have succeeded, failed and been reimagined since. Finally, we conclude with a contrastive look at program synthesis and future research recommendations for the field.},

Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size.

A DAN is composed of neural network modules, each encoding a differentiable robot algorithm and an associated model; and it is trained end-to-end from data. DAN combines the strengths of model-driven modular system design and data-driven end-to-end learning. The algorithms and models act as structural assumptions to reduce the data requirements for learning; end-to-end learning allows the modules to adapt to one another and compensate for imperfect models and algorithms, in order to achieve the best overall system performance. We illustrate the DAN methodology through a case study on a simulated robot system, which learns to navigate in complex 3-D environments with only local visual observations and an image of a partially correct 2-D floor map.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The rise of intraoperative information threatens to outpace our abilities to process it. Context-aware systems, filtering information to automatically adapt to the current needs of the surgeon, are necessary to fully profit from computerized surgery. To attain context awareness, representation of medical knowledge is crucial. However, most existing systems do not represent knowledge in a reusable way, hindering also reuse of data. Our purpose is therefore to make our computational models of medical knowledge sharable, extensible and interoperational with established knowledge representations in the form of the LapOntoSPM ontology. To show its usefulness, we apply it to situation interpretation, i.e., the recognition of surgical phases based on surgical activities. METHODS: Considering best practices in ontology engineering and building on our ontology for laparoscopy, we formalized the workflow of laparoscopic adrenalectomies, cholecystectomies and pancreatic resections in the framework of OntoSPM, a new standard for surgical process models. Furthermore, we provide a rule-based situation interpretation algorithm based on SQWRL to recognize surgical phases using the ontology. RESULTS: The system was evaluated on ground-truth data from 19 manually annotated surgeries. The aim was to show that the phase recognition capabilities are equal to a specialized solution. The recognition rates of the new system were equal to the specialized one. However, the time needed to interpret a situation rose from 0.5 to 1.8 s on average which is still viable for practical application. CONCLUSION: We successfully integrated medical knowledge for laparoscopic surgeries into OntoSPM, facilitating knowledge and data sharing. This is especially important for reproducibility of results and unbiased comparison of recognition algorithms. The associated recognition algorithm was adapted to the new representation without any loss of classification power. The work is an important step to standardized knowledge and data representation in the field on context awareness and thus toward unified benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {Meta-learning algorithms can accelerate the model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms by finding an initial set of parameters for the dynamical model such that the model can be trained to match the actual dynamics of the system with only a few data-points. However, in the real world, a robot might encounter any situation starting from motor failures to finding itself in a rocky terrain where the dynamics of the robot can be significantly different from one another. In this paper, first, we show that when meta-training situations (the prior situations) have such diverse dynamics, using a single set of meta-trained parameters as a starting point still requires a large number of observations from the real system to learn a useful model of the dynamics. Second, we propose an algorithm called FAMLE that mitigates this limitation by meta-training several initial starting points (i.e., initial parameters) for training the model and allows robots to select the most suitable starting point to adapt the model to the current situation with only a few gradient steps. We compare FAMLE to MBRL, MBRL with a meta-trained model with MAML, and model-free policy search algorithm PPO for various simulated and real robotic tasks, and show that FAMLE allows robots to adapt to novel damages in significantly fewer time-steps than the baselines.},

  abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (/spl ap/150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).},

Limitations of model-based control led to a generation of intelligent control techniques such as adaptive and fuzzy control. The human brain, on the other hand, is known to process a variety of inputs in parallel, and shift between different levels of cognitive activities while ignoring distractions to focus on the task in hand. This process, known as cognitive control in psychology, is unique to humans and a handful of animals. We are interested in implementing such cognitive control functionalities for our humanoid robot ISAC. This paper outlines the features of multiagent-based cognitive architecture for a humanoid robot and the progress made toward the realization of cognitive control functionalities using attention, working memory and internal rehearsal. Several experiments have been conducted to show that the implementation of an integrated cognitive robot architecture is feasible.}

This Poisson formulation considers all the points at once, without resorting to heuristic spatial partitioning or blending, and is therefore highly resilient to data noise. Unlike radial basis function schemes, our Poisson approach allows a hierarchy of locally supported basis functions, and therefore the solution reduces to a well conditioned sparse linear system. We describe a spatially adaptive multiscale algorithm whose time and space complexities are proportional to the size of the reconstructed model. Experimenting with publicly available scan data, we demonstrate reconstruction of surfaces with greater detail than previously achievable.},

The proposed system scales well with increasing number of reasoning rules required to support the knowledge-intensive manipulation tasks. The architecture combines the high-level robot control program with the reasoning engine in a modular way, thus improving the scalability of the system.

This paper considers the sub-task of surgical debridement: removing dead or damaged tissue fragments to allow the remaining healthy tissue to heal. We present an autonomous multilateral surgical debridement system using the Raven, an open-architecture surgical robot with two cable-driven 7 DOF arms. Our system combines stereo vision for 3D perception with trajopt, an optimization-based motion planner, and model predictive control (MPC). Laboratory experiments involving sensing, grasping, and removal of 120 fragments suggest that an autonomous surgical robot can achieve robustness comparable to human performance. Our robot system demonstrated the advantage of multilateral systems, as the autonomous execution was 1.5{\texttimes} faster with two arms than with one; however, it was two to three times slower than a human. Execution speed could be improved with better state estimation that would allow more travel between MPC steps and fewer MPC replanning cycles. The three primary contributions of this paper are: (1) introducing debridement as a sub-task of interest for surgical robotics, (2) demonstrating the first reliable autonomous robot performance of a surgical sub-task using the Raven, and (3) reporting experiments that highlight the importance of accurate state estimation for future research.

  abstract = {Visual robot perception has been challenging to successful robot manipulation in noisy, cluttered and dynamic environments. While some perception systems fail to provide an adequate semantics of the scene, others fail to present appropriate learning models and training data. Another major issue encountered in some robot perception systems is their inability to promptly respond to robot control programs whose realtimeness is crucial.This paper proposes an architecture to robot vision for manipulation tasks that addresses the three issues mentioned above. The architecture encompasses a generator of training datasets and a learnable scene describer, coined as RobotVQA for Robot Visual Question Answering. The architecture leverages the power of deep learning to predict and photo-realistic virtual worlds to train. RobotVQA takes as input a robot scene's RGB or RGBD image, detects all relevant objects in it, then describes in realtime each object in terms of category, color, material, shape, openability, 6D-pose and segmentation mask. Moreover, RobotVQA computes the qualitative spatial relations among those objects. We refer to such a scene description in this paper as scene graph or semantic graph of the scene. In RobotVQA, prediction and training take place in a unified manner. Finally, we demonstrate how RobotVQA is suitable for robot control systems that interpret perception as a question answering process.},

Here we present evidence to the contrary, particularly when using autoencoders to derive meaningful latent spaces from data with spatially global similarities and local differences, such as electronic health records (EHR) and medical imaging. We investigate batch size effects in both EHR data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and medical imaging data from the multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) challenge. We train fully connected and convolutional autoencoders to compress the EHR and imaging input spaces, respectively, into 32-dimensional latent spaces via reconstruction losses for various batch sizes between 1 and 100. Under the same hyperparameter configurations, smaller batches improve loss performance for both datasets. Additionally, latent spaces derived by autoencoders with smaller batches capture more biologically meaningful information. Qualitatively, we visualize 2-dimensional projections of the latent spaces and find that with smaller batches the EHR network better separates the sex of the individuals, and the imaging network better captures the right-left laterality of tumors. Quantitatively, the analogous sex classification and laterality regressions using the latent spaces demonstrate statistically significant improvements in performance at smaller batch sizes. Finally, we find improved individual variation locally in visualizations of representative data reconstructions at lower batch sizes. Taken together, these results suggest that smaller batch sizes should be considered when designing autoencoders to extract meaningful latent spaces among EHR and medical imaging data driven by global similarities and local variation.},

The NNW is used to predict the polishing performance parameters corresponding to a certain polishing parameters. In addition, the GA is employed to optimize the polishing parameters according to an objective function that includes the desired material removal and surface roughness improvement using the output from the trained NNW model. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through experiments of polishing uneven surface.},

Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.},

Nonetheless, we show that NPs suffer a fundamental drawback of underfitting, giving inaccurate predictions at the inputs of the observed data they condition on. We address this issue by incorporating attention into NPs, allowing each input location to attend to the relevant context points for the prediction. We show that this greatly improves the accuracy of predictions, results in noticeably faster training, and expands the range of functions that can be modelled.},

  abstract = {Large policies pretrained on a combination of Internet-scale vision-language data and diverse robot demonstrations have the potential to change how we teach robots new skills: rather than training new behaviors from scratch, we can fine-tune such vision-language-action (VLA) models to obtain robust, generalizable policies for visuomotor control. Yet, widespread adoption of VLAs for robotics has been challenging as 1) existing VLAs are largely closed and inaccessible to the public, and 2) prior work fails to explore methods for efficiently fine-tuning VLAs for new tasks, a key component for adoption. Addressing these challenges, we introduce OpenVLA, a 7B-parameter open-source VLA trained on a diverse collection of 970k real-world robot demonstrations. OpenVLA builds on a Llama 2 language model combined with a visual encoder that fuses pretrained features from DINOv2 and SigLIP. As a product of the added data diversity and new model components, OpenVLA demonstrates strong results for generalist manipulation, outperforming closed models such as RT-2-X (55B) by 16.5\% in absolute task success rate across 29 tasks and multiple robot embodiments, with 7x fewer parameters. We further show that we can effectively fine-tune OpenVLA for new settings, with especially strong generalization results in multi-task environments involving multiple objects and strong language grounding abilities, and outperform expressive from-scratch imitation learning methods such as Diffusion Policy by 20.4\%. We also explore compute efficiency; as a separate contribution, we show that OpenVLA can be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs via modern low-rank adaptation methods and served efficiently via quantization without a hit to downstream success rate. Finally, we release model checkpoints, fine-tuning notebooks, and our PyTorch codebase with built-in support for training VLAs at scale on Open X-Embodiment datasets.},

In this paper, we propose an intention understanding system that uses an Object Augmented-Supervised Multiple Timescale Recurrent Neural Network (OA-SMTRNN) and demonstrate the effects of perception--action connected learning in an artificial agent, which is inspired by psychological and neurological phenomena in humans. We believe that action and perception are not isolated processes in human mental development, and argue that these psychological and neurological interactions can be replicated in a human--machine scenario. The proposed OA-SMTRNN consists of perception and action modules and their connection, which are constructed of supervised multiple timescale recurrent neural networks and the deep auto-encoder, respectively, and connects their perception and action for understanding human intention. Our experimental results show the effects of perception--action connected learning, and demonstrate that robots can understand human intention with OA-SMTRNN through perception--action connected learning.},

Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.}

  abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. For FNNs we considered (i) ReLU networks without normalization, (ii) batch normalization, (iii) layer normalization, (iv) weight normalization, (v) highway networks, (vi) residual networks. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep.}

Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a system that enables humanoid robots to imitate complex whole-body motions of humans in real time. In our approach, we use a compact human model and consider the positions of the end-effectors as well as the center of mass as the most important aspects to imitate. Our system actively balances the center of mass over the support polygon to avoid falls of the robot, which would occur when using direct imitation. For every point in time, our approach generates a statically stable pose. Hereby, we do not constrain the configurations to be in double support. Instead, we allow for changes of the support mode according to the motions to imitate. To achieve safe imitation, we use retargeting of the robot's feet if necessary and find statically stable configurations by inverse kinematics. We present experiments using human data captured with an Xsens MVN motion capture system. The results show that a Nao humanoid is able to reliably imitate complex whole-body motions in real time, which also include extended periods of time in single support mode, in which the robot has to balance on one foot.},

  abstract = {Learning motions from human demonstrations provides an intuitive way for non-expert users to teach tasks to robots. In particular, intelligent robotic co-workers should not only mimic human demonstrations but should also be able to adapt them to varying application scenarios. As such, robots must have the ability to generalize motions to different workspaces, e.g. to avoid obstacles not present during original demonstrations. Towards this goal our work proposes a unified method to (1) generalize robot motions to different workspaces, using a novel formulation of trajectory optimization that explicitly incorporates human demonstrations, and (2) to locally adapt and reuse the optimized solution in the form of a distribution of trajectories. This optimized distribution can be used, online, to quickly satisfy via-points and goals of a specific task. We validate the method using a 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) lightweight arm that grasps and places a ball into different boxes while avoiding obstacles that were not present during the original human demonstrations.},

This is motivated by the fact that global policy optimization for non-linear systems could be a very challenging problem both algorithmically and numerically. However, a lot of robotic manipulation tasks are trajectory-centric, and thus do not require a global model or policy. Due to inaccuracies in the learned model estimates, an open-loop trajectory optimization process mostly results in very poor performance when used on the real system. Motivated by these problems, we try to formulate the problem of trajectory optimization and local policy synthesis as a single optimization problem. It is then solved simultaneously as an instance of nonlinear programming. We provide some results for analysis as well as achieved performance of the proposed technique under some simplifying assumptions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Complex oncological procedures pose various surgical challenges including dissection in distinct tissue planes and preservation of vulnerable anatomical structures throughout different surgical phases. In rectal surgery, violation of dissection planes increases the risk of local recurrence and autonomous nerve damage resulting in incontinence and sexual dysfunction. This work explores the feasibility of phase recognition and target structure segmentation in robot-assisted rectal resection (RARR) using machine learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 57 RARR were recorded and subsets of these were annotated with respect to surgical phases and exact locations of target structures (anatomical structures, tissue types, static structures, and dissection areas). For surgical phase recognition, three machine learning models were trained: LSTM, MSTCN, and Trans-SVNet. Based on pixel-wise annotations of target structures in 9037 images, individual segmentation models based on DeepLabv3 were trained. Model performance was evaluated using F1 score, Intersection-over-Union (IoU), accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity. RESULTS: The best results for phase recognition were achieved with the MSTCN model (F1 score: 0.82~{\textpm}~0.01, accuracy: 0.84~{\textpm}~0.03). Mean IoUs for target structure segmentation ranged from 0.14~{\textpm}~0.22 to 0.80~{\textpm}~0.14 for organs and tissue types and from 0.11~{\textpm}~0.11 to 0.44~{\textpm}~0.30 for dissection areas. Image quality, distorting factors (i.e. blood, smoke), and technical challenges (i.e. lack of depth perception) considerably impacted segmentation performance. CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based phase recognition and segmentation of selected target structures are feasible in RARR. In the future, such functionalities could be integrated into a context-aware surgical guidance system for rectal surgery.},

We revisit the paradigm of pre-training on large supervised datasets and fine-tuning the model on a target task. We scale up pre-training, and propose a simple recipe that we call Big Transfer (BiT). By combining a few carefully selected components, and transferring using a simple heuristic, we achieve strong performance on over 20 datasets. BiT performs well across a surprisingly wide range of data regimes---from 1 example per class to 1M total examples. BiT achieves 87.5\% top-1 accuracy on ILSVRC-2012, 99.4\% on CIFAR-10, and 76.3\% on the 19 task Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB). On small datasets, BiT attains 76.8\% on ILSVRC-2012 with 10 examples per class, and 97.0\% on CIFAR-10 with 10 examples per class. We conduct detailed analysis of the main components that lead to high transfer performance.},

These two tasks have become particularly prevalent topics recently because of their explosively emerging real-world applications, such as visual surveillance, autonomous driving vehicle, entertainment, and video retrieval, etc. Many attempts have been devoted in the last a few decades in order to build a robust and effective framework for action recognition and prediction.

This requires general-purpose methods that are, at this moment, not sufficiently performant for real-world applications. We propose an approach to specialize such general plans through running them for specific tasks and thereby learning appropriate specializations from experience. We present a system architecture, which collects data during plan execution for making up supervised learning problems and utilizes learned models for specializing the plans in a closed loop. We demonstrate our approach by letting a PR2 robot specialize its general fetch and place plan, whereby learned results are automatically installed into the plan. We show that the specialized plan performs better than the original plan in a statistically significant sense.}

The goal is to reduce the overall robot joint wear and to prevent uneven joint wear when one or several joints are stressed more than the other joints. Joint wear is approximated by calculating the integral of the mechanical work of each joint during the whole trajectory, which depends on the joint angular velocity and torque. The method relies on using a dynamic simulation for the evaluation of the torques and velocities in robot joints for individual robot positions. Verification of the method was performed using CoppeliaSim and a laboratory robotic cell with the collaborative robot UR3. The results confirmed that, with proper robot base placement, the overall wear of the joints of a robotic arm could be reduced from 22\% to 53\% depending on the trajectory.},

In order to assess the breadth of practical applications of cognitive architectures we present information on over 900 practical projects implemented using the cognitive architectures in our list. We use various visualization techniques to highlight the overall trends in the development of the field. In addition to summarizing the current state-of-the-art in the cognitive architecture research, this survey describes a variety of methods and ideas that have been tried and their relative success in modeling human cognitive abilities, as well as which aspects of cognitive behavior need more research with respect to their mechanistic counterparts and thus can further inform how cognitive science might progress.},

As societies develop and new technologies arise, new validated scales are needed. Robots and artificial intelligences of various kinds are about to occupy just about every niche in human society.

Here, we create and validate a novel multi-dimensional scale which measures people's attitudes towards robots, giving equal weight to positive and negative attitudes. Our scale differentiates (a) comfort and enjoyment around robots, (b) unease and anxiety around robots, (c) rational hopes about robots in general (at societal level) and (d) rational worries about robots in general (at societal level). The scale was developed by extracting items from previous scales, crowdsourcing new items, testing through 3 scale iterations by exploratory factor analysis (Ns 135, 801 and 609) and validated in its final form of the scale by confirmatory factor analysis (N: 477). We hope our scale will be a useful instrument for social scientists who wish to study human-technology relations with a validated scale in efficient and generalizable ways.},

In this work we investigate encoding short-term dynamics in a recurrent neural network, while we account for environmental constraints, such as obstacle avoidance, using gradient-based trajectory optimization. Experiments on real motion data demonstrate that our framework improves the prediction with respect to state-of-the-art motion prediction methods, as it accounts to beforehand unseen environmental structures. Moreover we demonstrate on an example, how this framework can be used to plan robot trajectories that are optimized to coordinate with a human partner.},

This architecture, in conjunction with a maximum a posteriori estimation scheme, is thus not calibrated nor robust. Approximate Bayesian inference has been empirically demonstrated to improve predictive uncertainty in neural networks, although the theoretical analysis of such Bayesian approximations is limited. We theoretically analyze approximate Gaussian distributions on the weights of ReLU networks and show that they fix the overconfidence problem. Furthermore, we show that even a simplistic, thus cheap, Bayesian approximation, also fixes these issues. This indicates that a sufficient condition for a calibrated uncertainty on a ReLU network is "to be a bit Bayesian". These theoretical results validate the usage of last-layer Bayesian approximation and motivate a range of a fidelity-cost trade-off. We further validate these findings empirically via various standard experiments using common deep ReLU networks and Laplace approximations.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called ``dropout'' that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

The last decade has seen substantial growth in research on the problem of robot manipulation, which aims to exploit the increasing availability of affordable robot arms and grippers to create robots capable of directly interacting with the world to achieve their goals. Learning will be central to such autonomous systems, as the real world contains too much variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate model of its environment, the objects in it, or the skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We aim to survey a representative subset of that research which uses machine learning for manipulation. We describe a formalization of the robot manipulation learning problem that synthesizes existing research into a single coherent framework and highlight the many remaining research opportunities and challenges.},

This paper suggests a new visual servo control scheme that uses an on-line trajectory generator as an intermediate layer between image processing algorithms and robot motion controllers. The motion generation algorithm is capable of computing an entire trajectory from an arbitrary initial state of motion within one servo control cycle (typically one millisecond or less). This algorithm is fed with desired pose and velocity signals that are generated by an image processing algorithm. The advantages of this new architecture are: (a) jerklimited and continuous motions are guaranteed independently of image processing signals, (b) kinematic motion constraints as well as physical and/or artificial workspace limits can be directly considered, and (c) the system can instantaneously and safely react to sensor failures (e.g., if cameras are covered or image processing fails). Real-world experimental results using a seven-joint robot arm are presented to underline the relevance for the field of robust sensor-guided robot motion control.},

The purpose of this work is the development of an algorithm based on the Gaussian distribution, which improves the convergence ability of PSO without the necessity of tuning these parameters. The only parameter to be specified by the user is the number of particles. The Gaussian PSO algorithm was tested on a suite of well-known benchmark functions and the results were compared with the results of the standard PSO algorithm.

The European Union for example used more 20.000.000 GWh electricity in 2011 based on the IEA Report [1]. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are able to reduce this amount, but they also help to increase the efficiency of machines above expectations which results in a more cost efficient production. Especially in the field of improving industrial plants, one of the challenges is the implementation of anomaly detection systems. For example as wear-level detection, which improves maintenance cycles and thus leads to a better energy usage. This paper presents an approach that uses timed hybrid automata of the machines normal behavior for a predictive maintenance of industrial plants. This hybrid model reduces discrete and continuous signals (e.g. energy data) to individual states, which refer to either the present condition of the machines. This allows an effective anomaly detection by implementing a combined data acquisition and anomaly detection approach, and the outlook for other applications, such as a predictive maintenance planning. Finally, this methodology is verified by three different industrial applications.},

While automated planning is able to decompose a complex task into a sequence of steps which reaches an intended goal, it is difficult to formulate such a goal without knowing the internals of the planning system and the exact capabilities of the robot. This becomes even more important in dynamic environments in which manipulable objects are subject to change. In this paper, we present an adaptive control interface which allows users to specify goals based on an internal world model by incrementally building referring expressions to the objects in the world. We consider fetch-and-carry tasks and automatically deduce potential high-level goals from the world model to make them available to the user. Based on its perceptions our system can react to changes in the environment by adapting the goal formulation within the domain-independent planning system.},

Among approaches embracing this paradigm, probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) are a well-established and widely used method to learn trajectory distributions. However, providing or requesting useful demonstrations is not easy, as quantifying what constitutes a good demonstration in terms of generalization capabilities is not trivial. In this letter, we propose an active learning method for contextual ProMPs for addressing this problem. More specifically, we learn the trajectory distributions using a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (BGMM) and then leverage the notion of epistemic uncertainties to iteratively choose new context query points for demonstrations. We show that this approach reduces the required number of human demonstrations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a pouring task, both in simulation and on a real 7-DoF Franka Emika robot.},

  abstract = {Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. One of the key difficulties is insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust policies. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for their own sake rather than to directly solve external goals. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical action-value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with goal-driven intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level q-value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, while a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse and delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process with stochastic transitions, and (2) the classic ATARI game -'Montezuma's Revenge'.},

The selection of the most appropriate optimisation algorithm, fitness function, and parameter space to maximise the benefit-cost ratio can dramatically improve the performance of the optimisation process. In this paper, we compare different meta-optimised optimisation algorithms, different fitness functions, and two different parameter spaces, in a physics-based simulation. The purpose of the comparison is to select the most appropriate combination to be used in hardware. The combination that yields the greatest increase in walk performance given a fixed expenditure is considered as the best, and is implemented in hardware. We found that Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning with a fitness function based on the efficiency and a parameter space expanded to include the joint stiffnesses not only performed the best, in terms of improving the walk speed and efficiency, but also in terms of selecting gaits that were more stable. This combination was then applied to the physical NAO, improving the default walk's speed by 57\% and its efficiency by 30\%.},

To enable intuitive, interactive, and reactive user interfaces, the motion plan computation should provide high-quality solutions quickly and in an anytime manner, meaning the algorithm progressively improves its solution and can be interrupted at any time and return a valid solution. To address these challenges, we combine two paradigms: (1) asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion planning, which is effective at providing anytime solutions but can struggle to quickly converge to high quality solutions in high dimensional configuration spaces, and (2) optimization, which locally refines paths quickly. We propose the use of interior point optimization for its ability to perform in an anytime manner that guarantees obstacle avoidance in each iteration, and we provide a novel lazy formulation that efficiently operates directly on point cloud data. Our method iteratively alternates between anytime sampling-based motion planning and anytime, lazy interior point optimization to compute high quality motion plans quickly, converging to a globally optimal solution.}

The use of such representations and processes, which we refer to as the algorithmic approach, is uniquely suited for problems requiring strong models, i.e., tasks and domains that are well defined, and/or involve close interaction with the environment. These problems have historically been the focus of robotics research because they exercise perceptual, motor and manipulation capabilities that form the basic foundational abilities required for every robotic agent. Recent work (for example ROS and Tekkotsu) on the abstraction and encapsulation of perception and motor functionality has standardized the above mentioned foundational abilities and allowed researchers to study problems in less clearly defined and open-ended domains: problems that have previously been considered the province of AI and Cognitive Science. In this paper, we argue that the study of these problems (examples of which include multi-agent interaction, instruction following and reasoning in complex domains) referred to under the rubric of Cognitive Robotics is best achieved via the use of cognitive architectures -- unified computational frameworks developed specifically for general problem solving and human cognitive modeling. We lay out the relevant architectural concepts and principles and illustrate them using nine cognitive architectures that are under active development -- Soar, ACT-R, CLARION, GMU-BICA, Polyscheme, Co-JACK, ADAPT, ACT-R/E, and SS-RICS.},

In this work, we ask how to imagine goal-directed visual plans -- a plausible sequence of observations that transition a dynamical system from its current configuration to a desired goal state, which can later be used as a reference trajectory for control. We focus on systems with high-dimensional observations, such as images, and propose an approach that naturally combines representation learning and planning. Our framework learns a generative model of sequential observations, where the generative process is induced by a transition in a low-dimensional planning model, and an additional noise. By maximizing the mutual information between the generated observations and the transition in the planning model, we obtain a low-dimensional representation that best explains the causal nature of the data. We structure the planning model to be compatible with efficient planning algorithms, and we propose several such models based on either discrete or continuous states. Finally, to generate a visual plan, we project the current and goal observations onto their respective states in the planning model, plan a trajectory, and then use the generative model to transform the trajectory to a sequence of observations. We demonstrate our method on imagining plausible visual plans of rope manipulation.}

  abstract = {Predicting high concentration antibody viscosity is essential for developing subcutaneous administration. Computer simulations provide promising tools to reach this aim. One such model is the spatial charge map (SCM) proposed by Agrawal and coworkers (mAbs. 2015, 8(1):43--48). SCM applies molecular dynamics simulations to calculate a score for the screening of antibody viscosity at high concentrations. However, molecular dynamics simulations are computationally costly and require structural information, a significant application bottleneck. In this work, high throughput computing was performed to calculate the SCM scores for 6596 nonredundant antibody variable regions. A convolutional neural network surrogate model, DeepSCM, requiring only sequence information, was then developed based on this dataset. The linear correlation coefficient of the DeepSCM and SCM scores achieved 0.9 on the test set (N~=~1320). The DeepSCM model was applied to screen the viscosity of 38 therapeutic antibodies that SCM correctly classified and resulted in only one misclassification. The DeepSCM model will facilitate high concentration antibody viscosity screening. The code and parameters are freely available at https://github.com/Lailabcode/DeepSCM.},

  abstract = {Our long-term goal is to develop autonomous robotic systems that have the cognitive abilities of humans, including communication, coordination, adapting to novel situations, and learning through experience. Our approach rests on the integration of the Soar cognitive architecture with both virtual and physical robotic systems. Soar has been used to develop a wide variety of knowledge-rich agents for complex virtual environments, including distributed training environments and interactive computer games. For development and testing in robotic virtual environments, Soar interfaces to a variety of robotic simulators and a simple mobile robot. We have recently made significant extensions to Soar that add new memories and new non-symbolic reasoning to Soar's original symbolic processing, which improves Soar abilities for control of robots. These extensions include mental imagery, episodic and semantic memory, reinforcement learning, and continuous model learning. This paper presents research in mobile robotics, relational and continuous model learning, and learning by situated, interactive instruction.}

In contrast, powerful sequence-tosequence (seq2seq) neural networks fail such tests of compositionality, especially when composing new concepts together with existing concepts. In this paper, I show how memory-augmented neural networks can be trained to generalize compositionally through meta seq2seq learning. In this approach, models train on a series of seq2seq problems to acquire the compositional skills needed to solve new seq2seq problems. Meta se2seq learning solves several of the SCAN tests for compositional learning and can learn to apply implicit rules to variables.},

We apply Professor Forcing to language modeling, vocal synthesis on raw waveforms, handwriting generation, and image generation. Empirically we find that Professor Forcing acts as a regularizer, improving test likelihood on character level Penn Treebank and sequential MNIST. We also find that the model qualitatively improves samples, especially when sampling for a large number of time steps. This is supported by human evaluation of sample quality.

Over the last decade, it has seen many successful applications, spanning localization and navigation, search and tracking, autonomous driving, multirobot systems, manipulation, and human--robot interaction. This survey aims to bridge the gap between the development of POMDP models and algorithms at one end and application to diverse robot decision tasks at the other. It analyzes the characteristics of these tasks and connects them with the mathematical and algorithmic properties of the POMDP framework for effective modeling and solution. For practitioners, the survey provides some of the key task characteristics in deciding when and how to apply POMDPs to robot tasks successfully. For POMDP algorithm designers, the survey provides new insights into the unique challenges of applying POMDPs to robot systems and points to promising new directions for further research.},

As the complexity of the task increases it becomes increasingly unlikely that tasks can always be executed without errors. Preventing errors beyond a certain point is economically infeasible, in particular for small-batch productions. As an alternative, we propose a system for automatically handling certain classes of errors instead of preventing them. Specifically, we show that many operations can be automatically reversed. Errors can be handled through automatic reverse execution of the control program to a safe point, from which forward execution can be resumed. This paper describes the principles behind automatic reversal of robotic assembly operations, and experimentally demonstrates the use of a domain-specific language that supports automatic error handling through reverse execution. Our contribution represents the first experimental demonstration of reversible computing principles applied to industrial robotics.},

An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.}

While adversarial training appears to enhance the robustness and safety of a deep model deployed in open-world decision-critical applications, counterintuitively, it induces undesired behaviors in robot learning settings. In this paper, we show theoretically and experimentally that neural controllers obtained via adversarial training are subjected to three types of defects, namely transient, systematic, and conditional errors. We first generalize adversarial training to a safety-domain optimization scheme allowing for more generic specifications. We then prove that such a learning process tends to cause certain error profiles. We support our theoretical results by a thorough experimental safety analysis in a robot-learning task. Our results suggest that adversarial training is not yet ready for robot learning.},

These policies are pretrained using the internal model with domain randomization over the relevant states. The policy network weights are then transferred to the target domain (e.g., the real world) for fine tuning. We perform extensive policy transfer experiments in simulation for two representative manipulation tasks: block stacking and crate opening. Our policies are shown to be more robust to domain shifts, more sample efficient to learn, and scale to more complex settings with larger state spaces. We also show improved zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of our policies for the block stacking task.},

We can compress this information by embedding the formula in a vector space, such that the vector associated with a statement can be used to predict whether a statement can be rewritten by other theorems. Predicting the embedding of a formula generated by some rewrite rule is naturally viewed as approximate reasoning in the latent space. In order to measure the effectiveness of this reasoning, we perform approximate deduction sequences in the latent space and use the resulting embedding to inform the semantic features of the corresponding formal statement (which is obtained by performing the corresponding rewrite sequence using real formulas). Our experiments show that graph neural networks can make non-trivial predictions about the rewrite-success of statements, even when they propagate predicted latent representations for several steps. Since our corpus of mathematical formulas includes a wide variety of mathematical disciplines, this experiment is a strong indicator for the feasibility of deduction in latent space in general.},

Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) algorithms typically solve these problems by conducting a tree search over high-level task sequences while checking for kinematic and dynamic feasibility. This can be inefficient as the width of the tree can grow exponentially with the number of possible actions and objects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to TAMP that relaxes discrete-and-continuous TAMP problems into inference problems on a continuous domain. Our method, Stein Task and Motion Planning (STAMP) subsequently solves this new problem using a gradient-based variational inference algorithm called Stein Variational Gradient Descent, by obtaining gradients from a parallelized differentiable physics simulator. By introducing relaxations to the discrete variables, leveraging parallelization, and approaching TAMP as an Bayesian inference problem, our method is able to efficiently find multiple diverse plans in a single optimization run. We demonstrate our method on two TAMP problems and benchmark them against existing TAMP baselines.},

Recent trends in time-series forecasting models are shifting from LSTM-based models to Transformer-based models. However, the Transformer-based model has a limited ability to represent sequential relationships in time-series data. In addition, the transformer-based model suffers from slow training and inference speed due to the bottleneck incurred by a deep encoder and step-by-step decoder inference. To address these problems, we propose a time-series forecasting optimized Transformer model, called TS-Fastformer. TS-Fastformer introduces three new optimizations: First, we propose a Sub Window Tokenizer for compressing input in a simple manner. The Sub Window Tokenizer reduces the length of input sequences to mitigate the complexity of self-attention and enables both single and multi-sequence learning. Second, we propose Time-series Pre-trained Encoder to extract effective representations through pre-training. This optimization enables TS-Fastformer to capture both seasonal and trend representations as well as to mitigate bottlenecks of conventional transformer models. Third, we propose the Past Attention Decoder to forecast target by incorporating past long short-term dependency patterns. Furthermore, Past Attention Decoder achieves high performance improvement by removing a trend distribution that changes over a long period. We evaluate the efficiency of our model with extensive experiments using seven real-world datasets and compare our model to six representative time-series forecasting approaches. The results show that the proposed TS-Fastformer reduces MSE by 10.1\% compared to state-of-the-art model and demonstrates 21.6\% faster training time compared to the existing fastest transformer, respectively.},

To foster user understanding and appropriate trust in such systems, we assessed the effects of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods and an educational intervention on AI-assisted decision-making behavior in a 2~{\texttimes}~2 between subjects online experiment with N=410 participants. We developed a novel use case in which users go on a virtual mushroom hunt and are tasked with picking edible and leaving poisonous mushrooms. Users were provided with an AI-based app that showed classification results of mushroom images. To manipulate explainability, one subgroup additionally received attribution-based and example-based explanations of the AI's predictions; for the educational intervention one subgroup received additional information on how the AI worked. We found that the group that received explanations outperformed that which did not and showed better calibrated trust levels. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the educational intervention, domain-specific (i.e., mushroom) knowledge, and AI knowledge had no effect on performance. We discuss practical implications and introduce the mushroom-picking task as a promising use case for XAI research.},

Three function approximators are compared: k-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Process Regression, and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Regression. In addition, we show that the memory can be used as a metric to choose between several possible goals, and using an ensemble method to combine different function approximators results in a significantly improved warm-starting performance.

  abstract = {The standard method for solving least squares problems which lead to non-linear normal equations depends upon a reduction of the residuals to linear form by first order Taylor approximations taken about an initial or trial solution for the parameters.2 If the usual least squares procedure, performed with these linear approximations, yields new values for the parameters which are not sufficiently close to the initial values, the neglect of second and higher order terms may invalidate the process, and may actually give rise to a larger value of the sum of the squares of the residuals than that corresponding to the initial solution. This failure of the standard method to improve the initial solution has received some notice in statistical applications of least squares3 and has been encountered rather frequently in connection with certain engineering applications involving the approximate representation of one function by another. The purpose of this article is to show how the problem may be solved by an extension of the standard method which insures improvement of the initial solution.4 The process can also be used for solving non-linear simultaneous equations, in which case it may be considered an extension of Newton's method. Let the function to be approximated be h\{x, y, z, {$\bullet$} {$\bullet$} {$\bullet$} ), and let the approximating function be H\{oc, y, z, {$\bullet$} {$\bullet$} \ding{110} ; a, j3, y, \ding{110} {$\bullet$} \ding{110} ), where a, /3, 7, {$\bullet$} \ding{110} \ding{110} are the unknown parameters.

In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: does training the perception and control systems jointly end-to-end provide better performance than training each component separately? To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a range of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between vision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated comparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.},

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping.},

We show that this hybrid approach requires many fewer samples than model-free methods, and can handle complex, nonsmooth dynamics that can pose a challenge for model-based techniques. We present experiments showing that our method can be used to learn complex neural network policies that successfully execute simulated robotic manipulation tasks in partially observed environments with numerous contact discontinuities and underactuation.}

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

In order to adequately explore these large spaces, we must evaluate a large number of configurations, typically orders of magnitude more configurations than available parallel workers. Given the growing costs of model training, we would ideally like to perform this search in roughly the same wall-clock time needed to train a single model. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing ASHA, a simple and robust hyperparameter tuning algorithm with solid theoretical underpinnings that exploits parallelism and aggressive early-stopping. Our extensive empirical results show that ASHA outperforms state-of-the hyperparameter tuning methods; scales linearly with the number of workers in distributed settings; converges to a high quality configuration in half the time taken by Vizier (Google's internal hyperparameter tuning service) in an experiment with 500 workers; and beats the published result for a near state-of-the-art LSTM architecture in under 2x the time to train a single model.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) trained on code-completion have been shown to be capable of synthesizing simple Python programs from docstrings [1]. We find that these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code, given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can express functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g., from object detectors [2], [3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided as input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii) generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g., velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (`faster') depending on context (i.e., behavioral commonsense). This paper presents Code as Policies: a robot-centric formulation of language model generated programs (LMPs) that can represent reactive policies (e.g., impedance controllers), as well as waypoint-based policies (vision-based pick and place, trajectory-based control), demonstrated across multiple real robot platforms. Central to our approach is prompting hierarchical code-gen (recursively defining undefined functions), which can write more complex code and also improves state-of-the-art to solve 39.8\% of problems on the HumanEval [1] benchmark.

To facilitate teleoperation efficiency, human-robot collaboration methods have been suggested, in which robot and human work together to accomplish a task. In this paper, we propose a semi-autonomous teleoperation method, with which operator can command the robot to reach the desired location via direct control at the initial phase, by virtue of the intent recognition algorithm, sub-task is recognized, and finally robot itself takes over the control to accomplish the task. A biological experiment is designed, and the direct control and semi-autonomous control strategies are compared through user studies. Execution time, task success rate and a subjective evaluation (NASA TLX) are used to quantify user performance. The trials show that our strategy can reduce workload and enhance operation accuracy significantly.},

  abstract = {The great diversity of end-user tasks ranging from manufacturing environments to personal homes makes pre-programming robots for general purpose applications extremely challenging. In fact, teaching robots new actions from scratch that can be reused for previously unseen tasks remains a difficult challenge and is generally left up to robotics experts. In this work, we present iRoPro, an interactive Robot Programming framework that allows end-users with little to no technical background to teach a robot new reusable actions. We combine Programming by Demonstration and Automated Planning techniques to allow the user to construct the robot's knowledge base by teaching new actions by kinesthetic demonstration. The actions are generalised and reused with a task planner to solve previously unseen problems defined by the user. We implement iRoPro as an end-to-end system on a Baxter Research Robot to simultaneously teach low- and high-level actions by demonstration that the user can customise via a Graphical User Interface to adapt to their specific use case. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we first conducted pre-design experiments to better understand the user's adoption of involved concepts and the proposed robot programming process. We compare results with post-design experiments, where we conducted a user study to validate the usability of our approach with real end-users. Overall, we showed that users with different programming levels and educational backgrounds can easily learn and use iRoPro and its robot programming process.},

However, current methods typically require too many interactions to achieve good performance. Data-inefficiency has limited these methods to learn force-sensitive tasks in real systems. In order to improve the sampling efficiency and decrease the required interactions during the learning process, this paper develops a data-efficient learning variable impedance control method that enables the industrial robots automatically learn to control the contact force in the unstructured environment. To this end, a Gaussian process model is learned as a faithful proxy of the system, which is then used to predict long-term state evolution for internal simulation, allowing for efficient strategy updates. The effects of model bias are reduced effectively by incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning. Then the impedance profiles are regulated online according to the learned humanlike impedance strategy. In this way, the flexibility and adaptivity of the system could be enhanced. Both simulated and experimental tests have been performed on an industrial manipulator to verify the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Most common navigation tasks in human environments require auxiliary arm interactions, e.g. opening doors, pressing buttons and pushing obstacles away. This type of navigation tasks, which we call Interactive Navigation, requires the use of mobile manipulators: mobile bases with manipulation capabilities. Interactive Navigation tasks are usually long-horizon and composed of heterogeneous phases of pure navigation, pure manipulation, and their combination. Using the wrong part of the embodiment is inefficient and hinders progress. We propose HRL4IN, a novel Hierarchical RL architecture for Interactive Navigation tasks. HRL4IN exploits the exploration benefits of HRL over flat RL for long-horizon tasks thanks to temporally extended commitments towards subgoals. Different from other HRL solutions, HRL4IN handles the heterogeneous nature of the Interactive Navigation task by creating subgoals in different spaces in different phases of the task. Moreover, HRL4IN selects different parts of the embodiment to use for each phase, improving energy efficiency. We evaluate HRL4IN against flat PPO and HAC, a state-of-the-art HRL algorithm, on Interactive Navigation in two environments - a 2D grid-world environment and a 3D environment with physics simulation. We show that HRL4IN significantly outperforms its baselines in terms of task performance and energy efficiency. More information is available at this https URL.}

In addition, a deformation compensation algorithm is proposed for the accuracy improvement. Both of these algorithms are formulated by dual quaternion algebra, which offers a compact, efficient, and singularity-free way in robot analysis. The joint stiffness identification algorithm is derived from stiffness modeling, which is the combination of the principle of virtual work and dual quaternion algebra. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification algorithm and deformation compensation algorithm, an experiment was conducted on a dual arm industrial robot SDA5F. The robot performed a drilling operation during the experiment, and the forces and torques that acted on the end-effector (EE) of both arms were measured in order to apply the deformation compensation algorithm. The results of the experiment show that the proposed identification algorithm is able to identify the joint stiffness parameters of serial industrial robots, and the deformation compensation algorithm can improve the accuracy of the position and orientation of the EE. Furthermore, the performance of the forces and torques that acted on the EE during the operation were improved as well.}

Unlike most traditional robotic development processes that are essentially process-centric, RoboFlow is data-centric. This striking property makes it especially suitable for developing AI-enhanced robots in which data play a central role. More specifically, RoboFlow models the whole robotic development process into 4 building modules (1. data processing, 2. algorithmic development, 3. back testing and 4. application adaptation) interacting with a centralized data engine. All these building modules are containerized and orchestrated under a unified interfacing framework. Such an architectural design greatly increases the maintainability and re-usability of all the building modules and enables us to develop them in a fully parallel fashion. To demonstrate the efficacy of the developed system, we exploit it to develop two prototype systems named ``Egomobility" and ``Egoplan". Egomobility provides general-purpose navigation functionalities for a wide variety of mobile robots and Egoplan solves path planning problems in high dimensional continuous state and action spaces for robot arms. Our result shows that RoboFlow can significantly streamline the whole development lifecycle and the same workflow is applicable to numerous intelligent robotic applications.},

We give each point on the surface a uv-coordinates naturally represented by a complex number, except for a small number of zero points (singularities). We show that natural, efficient robot paths can be obtained by using such coordinate systems. The method is based on intrinsic geometry and thus can be adapted to general surface exploration in 3D.},

  abstract = {Panoptic Part Segmentation (PPS) aims to unify panoptic segmentation and part segmentation into one task. Previous work mainly utilizes separated approaches to handle thing, stuff, and part predictions individually without performing any shared computation and task association. In this work, we aim to unify these tasks at the architectural level, designing the first end-to-end unified method named Panoptic-PartFormer. In particular, motivated by the recent progress in Vision Transformer, we model things, stuff, and part as object queries and directly learn to optimize the all three predictions as unified mask prediction and classification problem. We design a decoupled decoder to generate part feature and thing/stuff feature respectively. Then we propose to utilize all the queries and corresponding features to perform reasoning jointly and iteratively. The final mask can be obtained via inner product between queries and the corresponding features. The extensive ablation studies and analysis prove the effectiveness of our framework. Our Panoptic-PartFormer achieves the new state-of-the-art results on both Cityscapes PPS and Pascal Context PPS datasets with around 70\% GFlops and 50\% parameters decrease. Given its effectiveness and conceptual simplicity, we hope the Panoptic-PartFormer can serve as a strong baseline and aid future research in PPS.

  abstract = {Fine-tuning is the de facto way of leveraging large pretrained language models for downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning modifies all the language model parameters and therefore necessitates storing a full copy for each task. In this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters frozen and instead optimizes a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors, which we call the prefix. Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting for language models, allowing subsequent tokens to attend to this prefix as if it were ``virtual tokens''. We apply prefix-tuning to GPT-2 for table-to-text generation and to BART for summarization. We show that by learning only 0.1\% of the parameters, prefix-tuning obtains comparable performance in the full data setting, outperforms fine-tuning in low-data settings, and extrapolates better to examples with topics that are unseen during training.}

MPs can be broadly categorized into two types: (a) dynamics-based approaches that generate smooth trajectories from any initial state, e. g., Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), and (b) probabilistic approaches that capture higher-order statistics of the motion, e. g., Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs). To date, however, there is no MP method that unifies both, i. e. that can generate smooth trajectories from an arbitrary initial state while capturing higher-order statistics. In this letter, we introduce a unified perspective of both approaches by solving the ODE underlying the DMPs. We convert expensive online numerical integration of DMPs into position and velocity basis functions that can be used to represent trajectories or trajectory distributions similar to ProMPs while maintaining all the properties of dynamical systems. Since we inherit the properties of both methodologies, we call our proposed model Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs). Additionally, we embed ProDMPs in deep neural network architecture and propose a new cost function for efficient end-to-end learning of higher-order trajectory statistics. To this end, we leverage Bayesian Aggregation for non-linear iterative conditioning on sensory inputs. Our proposed model achieves smooth trajectory generation, goal-attractor convergence, correlation analysis, nonlinear conditioning, and online re-planing in one framework.},

We improved the You Only Look Once (YOLO) network and made it all convolutional. Our improved network, which consists of 27 convolution layers, provides an end-to-end solution for the surface defects detection of steel strip.

Besides, our network achieves 99\% detection rate with speed of 83 FPS, which provides methodological support for real-time surface defects detection of steel strip.

In this paper, we propose a learning model to update the exploration rate adaptively. We blend the advantages of several previous methods. Smooth trajectories for the robot control system can be produced by the updated exploration rate which maximizes the lower bound of the expected return. Our method is tested in the ball-in-cup problem. The results show that our method can receive the same learning outcome as the previous methods with fewer iterations.},

  abstract = {Informative and discriminative feature descriptors play a fundamental role in deformable shape analysis. For example, they have been successfully employed in correspondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In recent years, significant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the shape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and the recently introduced wave kernel signature (WKS). The Laplacian-based descriptors achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are computationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can gracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate a generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that to be optimized for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the statistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the signal) and those of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the noise). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be learned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal processing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimized spectral descriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of the proposed approach in generating correspondences is demonstrated on synthetic and scanned human figures. We also show that the learned descriptors are robust enough to be learned on synthetic data and transferred successfully to scanned shapes.},

This adjustment is nowadays routinely performed so as to benefit of the latest improvements of convolutional neural networks trained on large databases. Fine-tuning requires some form of regularization, which is typically implemented by weight decay that drives the network parameters towards zero. This choice conflicts with the motivation for fine-tuning, as starting from a pre-trained solution aims at taking advantage of the previously acquired knowledge. Hence, regularizers promoting an explicit inductive bias towards the pre-trained model have been recently proposed. This paper demonstrates the versatility of this type of regularizer across transfer learning scenarios. We replicated experiments on three state-of-the-art approaches in image classification, image segmentation, and video analysis to compare the relative merits of regularizers. These tests show systematic improvements compared to weight decay. Our experimental protocol put forward the versatility of a regularizer that is easy to implement and to operate that we eventually recommend as the new baseline for future approaches to transfer learning relying on fine-tuning.},

We introduce the Context-Aware Grasping Engine, which combines a novel semantic representation of grasp contexts with a neural network structure based on the Wide \& Deep model, capable of capturing complex reasoning patterns. We quantitatively validate our approach against three prior methods on a novel dataset consisting of 14,000 semantic grasps for 44 objects, 7 tasks, and 6 different object states. Our approach outperformed all baselines by statistically significant margins, producing new insights into the importance of balancing memorization and generalization of contexts for semantic grasping. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on robot experiments in which the presented model successfully achieved 31 of 32 suitable grasps.

  abstract = {An intelligent agent operating in the real-world must balance achieving its goal with maintaining the safety and comfort of not only itself, but also other participants within the surrounding scene. This requires jointly reasoning about the behavior of other actors while deciding its own actions as these two processes are inherently intertwined - a vehicle will yield to us if we decide to proceed first at the intersection but will proceed first if we decide to yield. However, this is not captured in most self-driving pipelines, where planning follows prediction. In this paper we propose a novel data-driven, reactive planning objective which allows a self-driving vehicle to jointly reason about its own plans as well as how other actors will react to them. We formulate the problem as an energy-based deep structured model that is learned from observational data and encodes both the planning and prediction problems. Through simulations based on both real-world driving and synthetically generated dense traffic, we demonstrate that our reactive model outperforms a non-reactive variant in successfully completing highly complex maneuvers (lane merges/turns in traffic) faster, without trading off collision rate.},

The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories, we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension for objects specified with attributes.

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method.

We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

This is especially critical in the data-driven active learning setting where the goal is to achieve a certain accuracy with minimum labeling effort. In such settings, the model learns to select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation based on its estimated uncertainty. The highly uncertain predictions are assumed to be more informative for improving model performance. In this paper, we explore uncertainty calibration within an active learning framework for medical image segmentation, an area where labels often are scarce. Various uncertainty estimation methods and acquisition strategies (regions and full images) are investigated. We observe that selecting regions to annotate instead of full images leads to more well-calibrated models. Additionally, we experimentally show that annotating regions can cut 50\% of pixels that need to be labeled by humans compared to annotating full images.},

To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents. Code, train {\textbackslash}\& test data, and part of fine-tuned open LMMs are available at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/THUDM/VisualAgentBench\}.},

By instruction tuning on such generated data, we introduce LLaVA: Large Language and Vision Assistant, an end-to-end trained large multimodal model that connects a vision encoder and LLM for general-purpose visual and language understanding.Our early experiments show that LLaVA demonstrates impressive multimodel chat abilities, sometimes exhibiting the behaviors of multimodal GPT-4 on unseen images/instructions, and yields a 85.1\% relative score compared with GPT-4 on a synthetic multimodal instruction-following dataset. When fine-tuned on Science QA, the synergy of LLaVA and GPT-4 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.53\%. We make GPT-4 generated visual instruction tuning data, our model and code base publicly available.},

  abstract = {Wind energy has developed rapidly over the last two decades to become one of the most promising and economically viable sources of renewable energy. Although wind energy is claimed to provide clean renewable energy without any emissions during operation, but it is only one side of the coin. The blades, one of the most important components in the wind turbines, made with composite, are currently regarded as unrecyclable. With the first wave of early commercial wind turbine installations now approaching their end of life, the problem of blade disposal is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future. This paper is aimed at discovering the magnitude of the wind turbine blade waste problem, looking not only at disposal but at all stages of a blade's lifecycle. The first stage of the research, the subject of this paper, is to accurately estimate present and future wind turbine blade waste inventory using the most recent and most accurate data available. The result will provide a solid reference point to help the industry and policy makers to understand the size of potential environmental problem and to help to manage it better. This study starts by estimating the annual blade material usage with wind energy installed capacity and average blade weight. The effect of other waste contributing factors in the full lifecycle of wind turbine blades is then included, using industrial data from the manufacturing, testing and in-service stages. The research indicates that there will be 43 million tonnes of blade waste worldwide by 2050 with China possessing 40\% of the waste, Europe 25\%, the United States 16\% and the rest of the world 19\%.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in vision language foundation models has shown their ability to understand multimodal data and resolve complicated vision language tasks, including robotics manipulation. We seek a straightforward way of making use of existing vision-language models (VLMs) with simple fine-tuning on robotics data. To this end, we derive a simple and novel vision-language manipulation framework, dubbed RoboFlamingo, built upon the open-source VLMs, OpenFlamingo. Unlike prior works, RoboFlamingo utilizes pre-trained VLMs for single-step vision-language comprehension, models sequential history information with an explicit policy head, and is slightly fine-tuned by imitation learning only on language-conditioned manipulation datasets. Such a decomposition provides RoboFlamingo the flexibility for open-loop control and deployment on low-performance platforms. By exceeding the state-of-the-art performance with a large margin on the tested benchmark, we show RoboFlamingo can be an effective and competitive alternative to adapt VLMs to robot control. Our extensive experimental results also reveal several interesting conclusions regarding the behavior of different pre-trained VLMs on manipulation tasks. We believe RoboFlamingo has the potential to be a cost-effective and easy-to-use solution for robotics manipulation, empowering everyone with the ability to fine-tune their own robotics policy. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.},

Although techniques for automating the process exist, most involve local function optimization procedures that suffer from three key drawbacks. Local optimization techniques are naturally plagued by local optima, make no use of the expensive gait evaluations once a local step is taken, and do not explicitly model noise in gait evaluation. These drawbacks increase the need for a large number of gait evaluations, making optimization slow, data inefficient, and manually intensive. We present a Bayesian approach based on Gaussian process regression that addresses all three drawbacks. It uses a global search strategy based on a posterior model inferred from all of the individual noisy evaluations. We demonstrate the technique on a quadruped robot, using it to optimize two different criteria: speed and smoothness. We show in both cases our technique requires dramatically fewer gait evaluations than state-of-the-art local gradient approaches.}

  abstract = {Recent studies reveal that a deep neural network can learn transferable features which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However, as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this paper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation scenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with statistical guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel embedding. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed architecture yields state-of-the-art image classification error rates on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep networks that can jointly learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. We relax a shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. We enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into deep network to explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier. We fuse features of multiple layers with tensor product and embed them into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to match distributions for feature adaptation. The adaptation can be achieved in most feed-forward models by extending them with new residual layers and loss functions, which can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Empirical evidence shows that the new approach outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Neural networks predictions are unreliable when the input sample is out of the training distribution or corrupted by noise. Being able to detect such failures automatically is fundamental to integrate deep learning algorithms into robotics. Current approaches for uncertainty estimation of neural networks require changes to the network and optimization process, typically ignore prior knowledge about the data, and tend to make over-simplifying assumptions which underestimate uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty estimation. Based on Bayesian belief networks and Monte-Carlo sampling, our framework not only fully models the different sources of prediction uncertainty, but also incorporates prior data information, e.g. sensor noise. We show theoretically that this gives us the ability to capture uncertainty better than existing methods. In addition, our framework has several desirable properties: (i) it is agnostic to the network architecture and task; (ii) it does not require changes in the optimization process; (iii) it can be applied to already trained architectures. We thoroughly validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on both computer vision and control tasks, where we outperform previous methods by up to 23\% in accuracy. The video available at https://youtu.be/X7nbRS5vSM shows qualitative results of our experiments. The project's code is available at: https://tinyurl.com/s3nygw7.}

This theoretical account of autonomy is embedded in the larger SMART framework and is intimately linked with the issue of motivation. Autonomous agents are motivated agents in that for the generation of goals an agent needs a set of higher order, non-derivative sources of action, or in our terminology, motivations. Autonomous agents in the SMART framework form the basis and source of action in multi-agent systems, which can thus propagate through the other entities in the system, such as non-autonomous agents and objects. We conclude with a discussion regarding the situations an autonomous agent would be willing to relinquish its autonomy thus linking the generative and variable notions of autonomy.},

  abstract = {The exploding research interest for neural networks in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is largely explained by the networks' capacity to model complex input-output relations directly from data. However, they typically need vast training data before they can be put to any good use. The data generation process for dynamical systems can be an expensive endeavor both in terms of time and resources. Active learning addresses this shortcoming by acquiring the most informative data, thereby reducing the need to collect enormous datasets. What makes the current work unique is integrating the deep active learning framework into nonlinear system identification. We formulate a general static deep active learning acquisition problem for nonlinear system identification. This is enabled by exploring system dynamics locally in different regions of the input space to obtain a simulated dataset covering the broader input space. This simulated dataset can be used in a static deep active learning acquisition scheme referred to as global explorations. The global exploration acquires a batch of initial states corresponding to the most informative state-action trajectories according to a batch acquisition function. The local exploration solves an optimal control problem, finding the control trajectory that maximizes some measure of information. After a batch of informative initial states is acquired, a new round of local explorations from the initial states in the batch is conducted to obtain a set of corresponding control trajectories that are to be applied on the system dynamics to get data from the system. Information measures used in the acquisition scheme are derived from the predictive variance of an ensemble of neural networks. The novel method outperforms standard data acquisition methods used for system identification of nonlinear dynamical systems in the case study performed on simulated data.},

  abstract = {Increasing volumes of wind turbine blades (WTBs) meeting their end-of-life are expected in the coming years, while establishing sustainable value chains for handling the blades is still at an early stage. Through a systematic literature identification and review process, current literature on sustainable end-of-life management and technologies for wind turbine blades is identified to map state-of-the-art. The review resulted in the identification of four overarching research themes with sixteen underlying research topics. The study findings highlight that research so far has mainly been focused on recycling technologies and material properties of recovered WTB material. Furthermore, none of the reviewed literature contained empirical data from end-of-life blade projects. Thus, there is a lack of data and knowledge on the complete value chain, including processes of logistics, sectioning, pre-processing, and refining recovered materials for secondary applications. Furthermore, the understanding of the environmental, social, and cost impacts of these processes are also found to be absent. Based on a consolidation of findings, a complete value chain roadmap of required processes and technologies for sustainable end-of-life routes of WTBs is presented. The roadmap and results illustrate a baseline for current practices but also calls for further research into optimization and impact assessment of value chains. Thus, the presented roadmap has implications for academia, wind turbine producers and owners to aid the assessment of which practices and technologies to utilize when decommissioning WTBs.},

  abstract = {Offline programming (OLP) is a mainstream approach for controlling assembly robots at construction sites. However, existing methods are tailored to specific assembly tasks and workflows, and thus lack flexibility. Additionally, the emerging large language model (LLM)-based OLP cannot effectively handle the code logic of robot programming. Thus, this paper addresses the question: How can robot control programs be generated effectively and accurately for diverse construction assembly tasks using LLM techniques? This paper describes a closed user-on-the-loop control framework for construction assembly robots based on LLM techniques. A hierarchical strategy to generate robot control programs is proposed to logically integrate code generation at high and low levels. Additionally, customized application programming interfaces and a chain of action are combined to enhance the LLM's understanding of assembly action logic. An assembly task set was designed to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach (1) is widely applicable to diverse assembly tasks, and (2) can improve the quality of the generated code by decreasing the number of errors. Our approach facilitates the automation of construction assembly tasks by simplifying the robot control process.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning (IL) enables robots to acquire skills quickly by transferring expert knowledge, which is widely adopted in reinforcement learning (RL) to initialize exploration. However, in long-horizon motion planning tasks, a challenging problem in deploying IL and RL methods is how to generate and collect massive, broadly distributed data such that these methods can generalize effectively. In this work, we solve this problem using our proposed approach called \{self-imitation learning by planning (SILP)\}, where demonstration data are collected automatically by planning on the visited states from the current policy. SILP is inspired by the observation that successfully visited states in the early reinforcement learning stage are collision-free nodes in the graph-search based motion planner, so we can plan and relabel robot's own trials as demonstrations for policy learning. Due to these self-generated demonstrations, we relieve the human operator from the laborious data preparation process required by IL and RL methods in solving complex motion planning tasks. The evaluation results show that our SILP method achieves higher success rates and enhances sample efficiency compared to selected baselines, and the policy learned in simulation performs well in a real-world placement task with changing goals and obstacles.},

  abstract = {We propose learning from teleoperated play data (LfP) as a way to scale up multi-task robotic skill learning. Learning from play (LfP) offers three main advantages: 1) It is cheap. Large amounts of play data can be collected quickly as it does not require scene staging, task segmenting, or resetting to an initial state. 2) It is general. It contains both functional and non-functional behavior, relaxing the need for a predefined task distribution. 3) It is rich. Play involves repeated, varied behavior and naturally leads to high coverage of the possible interaction space. These properties distinguish play from expert demonstrations, which are rich, but expensive, and scripted unattended data collection, which is cheap, but insufficiently rich. Variety in play, however, presents a multimodality challenge to methods seeking to learn control on top. To this end, we introduce Play-LMP, a method designed to handle variability in the LfP setting by organizing it in an embedding space. Play-LMP jointly learns 1) reusable latent plan representations unsupervised from play data and 2) a single goal-conditioned policy capable of decoding inferred plans to achieve user-specified tasks. We show empirically that Play-LMP, despite not being trained on task-specific data, is capable of generalizing to 18 complex user-specified manipulation tasks with average success of 85.5\%, outperforming individual models trained on expert demonstrations (success of 70.3\%). Furthermore, we find that play-supervised models, unlike their expert-trained counterparts, 1) are more robust to perturbations and 2) exhibit retrying-till-success. Finally, despite never being trained with task labels, we find that our agent learns to organize its latent plan space around functional tasks.

  abstract = {Mesh generation is of great value in various applications involving computer graphics and virtual content, yet designing generative models for meshes is challenging due to their irregular data structure and inconsistent topology of meshes in the same category. In this work, we design a novel sparse latent point diffusion model for mesh generation. Our key insight is to regard point clouds as an intermediate representation of meshes, and model the distribution of point clouds instead. While meshes can be generated from point clouds via techniques like Shape as Points (SAP), the challenges of directly generating meshes can be effectively avoided. To boost the efficiency and controllability of our mesh generation method, we propose to further encode point clouds to a set of sparse latent points with pointwise semantic meaningful features, where two DDPMs are trained in the space of sparse latent points to respectively model the distribution of the latent point positions and features at these latent points. We find that sampling in this latent space is faster than directly sampling dense point clouds. Moreover, the sparse latent points also enable us to explicitly control both the overall structures and local details of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments are conducted on the ShapeNet dataset, where our proposed sparse latent point diffusion model achieves superior performance in terms of generation quality and controllability when compared to existing methods.

  abstract = {Robot kinematic errors, both static and joint-dependent, were classified.A new robot calibration and compensation methodology was presented.The new method is capable of reducing high-order joint-dependent kinematic errors. Robot positioning accuracy is critically important in many manufacturing applications. While geometric errors such as imprecise link length and assembly misalignment dominate positioning errors in industrial robots, significant errors also arise from non-uniformities in bearing systems and strain wave gearings. These errors are characteristically more complicated than the fixed geometric errors in link lengths and assembly. Typical robot calibration methods only consider constant kinematic errors, thus, neglecting complex kinematic errors and limiting the accuracy to which robots can be calibrated. In contrast to typical calibration methods, this paper considers models containing both constant and joint-dependent kinematic errors. Constituent robot kinematic error sources are identified and kinematic error models are classified for each error source. The constituent models are generalized into a single robot kinematic error model with both constant and high-order joint-dependent error terms. Maximum likelihood estimation is utilized to identify error model parameters using measurements obtained over the measurable joint space by a laser tracker. Experiments comparing the proposed and traditional calibration methods implemented on a FANUC LR Mate 200i robot are presented and analyzed. While the traditional constant kinematic error model describes 79.4\% of the measured error, the proposed modeling framework, constructed from measurements of 250 poses, describes 97.0\% of the measured error.

  abstract = {Intelligent agents should have the ability to leverage knowledge from previously learned tasks in order to learn new ones quickly and efficiently. Meta-learning approaches have emerged as a popular solution to achieve this. However, meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms have thus far been restricted to simple environments with narrow task distributions and have seen limited success. Moreover, the paradigm of pretraining followed by fine-tuning to adapt to new tasks has emerged as a simple yet effective solution in supervised learning. This calls into question the benefits of meta learning approaches also in reinforcement learning, which typically come at the cost of high complexity. We therefore investigate meta-RL approaches in a variety of vision-based benchmarks, including Procgen, RLBench, and Atari, where evaluations are made on completely novel tasks. Our findings show that when meta-learning approaches are evaluated on different tasks (rather than different variations of the same task), multi-task pretraining with fine-tuning on new tasks performs equally as well, or better, than meta-pretraining with meta test-time adaptation. This is encouraging for future research, as multi-task pretraining tends to be simpler and computationally cheaper than meta-RL. From these findings, we advocate for evaluating future meta-RL methods on more challenging tasks and including multi-task pretraining with fine-tuning as a simple, yet strong baseline.},

  abstract = {While the identification of nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental building block of model-based reinforcement learning and feedback control, its sample complexity is only understood for systems that either have discrete states and actions or for systems that can be identified from data generated by i.i.d. random inputs. Nonetheless, many interesting dynamical systems have continuous states and actions and can only be identified through a judicious choice of inputs. Motivated by practical settings, we study a class of nonlinear dynamical systems whose state transitions depend linearly on a known feature embedding of state-action pairs. To estimate such systems in finite time identification methods must explore all directions in feature space. We propose an active learning approach that achieves this by repeating three steps: trajectory planning, trajectory tracking, and re-estimation of the system from all available data. We show that our method estimates nonlinear dynamical systems at a parametric rate, similar to the statistical rate of standard linear regression.}

  abstract = {Many of today's robot perception systems aim at accomplishing perception tasks that are too simplistic and too hard. They are too simplistic because they do not require the perception systems to provide all the information needed to accomplish manipulation tasks. Typically the perception results do not include information about the part structure of objects, articulation mechanisms and other attributes needed for adapting manipulation behavior. On the other hand, the perception problems stated are also too hard because --- unlike humans--- the perception systems cannot leverage the expectations about what they will see to their full potential. Therefore, we investigate a variation of robot perception tasks suitable for robots accomplishing everyday manipulation tasks, such as household robots or a robot in a retail store. In such settings it is reasonable to assume that robots know most objects and have detailed models of them. We propose a perception system that maintains its beliefs about its environment as a scene graph with physics simulation and visual rendering. When detecting objects, the perception system retrieves the model of the object and places it at the corresponding place in a VR-based environment model. The physics simulation ensures that object detections that are physically not possible are rejected and scenes can be rendered to generate expectations at the image level. The result is a perception system that can provide useful information for manipulation tasks.},

In order to construct a program satisfying certain specifications, a theorem induced by those specifications is proved, and the desired program is extracted from the proof. The same technique is applied to transform recursively defined functions into iterative programs, frequently with a major gain in efficiency. It is emphasized that in order to construct a program with loops or with recursion, the principle of mathematical induction must be applied.

An automatic program synthesis system must combine reasoning and programming ability with a good deal of knowledge about the subject matter of the program. This ability and knowledge must be manifested both procedurally (by programs) and structurally (by choice of representation). We describe some of the reasoning and programming capabilities of a projected synthesis system. Special attention is paid to the introduction of conditional tests, loops, and instructions with side effects in the program being constructed. The ability to satisfy several interacting goals simultaneously proves to be important in many contexts. The modification of an already existing program to solve a somewhat different problem has been found to be a powerful approach. We illustrate these concepts with hand simulations of the synthesis of a number of pattern-matching programs. Some of these techniques have already been implemented, some are in the course of implementation, while others seem equivalent to well-known unsolved problems in artificial intelligence.}

Summary Background Data:~           Innovative surgical devices have preceded many of the major advances in surgical practice. However, the process by which devices arising from academia find their way to translation remains poorly understood.           Methods:~           All biomedical engineering journals, and the 5 basic science journals with the highest impact factor, were searched between January 1993 and January 2000 using the Boolean search term ``surgery OR surgeon OR surgical''. Articles were included if they described the development of a new device and a surgical application was described. A recursive search of all citations to the article was performed using the Web of Science (Thompson-Reuters, New York, NY) to identify any associated first-in-human studies published by January 2015. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for the time to first-in-human studies. Factors influencing translation were evaluated using log-rank and Cox proportional hazards models.           Results:~           A total of 8297 articles were screened, and 205 publications describing unique devices were identified. The probability of a first-in-human at 10 years was 9.8\%. Clinical involvement was a significant predictor of a first-in-human study (P = 0.02); devices developed with early clinical collaboration were over 6 times more likely to be translated than those without [RR 6.5 (95\% confidence interval 0.9--48)].           Conclusions:~           These findings support initiatives to increase clinical translation through improved interactions between basic, translational, and clinical researchers.},

Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of automatic differentiation however requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and efficient methods to perform higher-order differentiation.},

This means special communication, its tools can be standards or standardized methodology to ensure quality throughout the production chain from the processing of raw materials to final assembly of the vehicle on the production line, its testing and the delivery to the customer. The basic precondition of Industry 4.0 strategy is communication in its broadest understanding. Communication or interconnection is conditioned by the application of generally accepted standards. Part of this connection is the focus on integrated management systems. The philosophy of Industry 4.0 is to minimize the risks as part of functional management systems. Timely and correct communication creates conditions for quality of a product at the end of the production and supply chain, i.e., a car according to customer requirements.},

  abstract = {The flexibility of the human hand in object manipulation is essential for daily life activities, but remains relatively little explored with quantitative methods. On the one hand, recent taxonomies describe qualitatively the classes of hand postures for object grasping and manipulation. On the other hand, the quantitative analysis of hand function has been generally restricted to precision grip (with thumb and index opposition) during lifting tasks. The aim of the present study is to fill the gap between these two kinds of descriptions, by investigating quantitatively the forces exerted by the hand on an instrumented object in a set of representative manipulation tasks. The object was a parallelepiped object able to measure the force exerted on the six faces and its acceleration. The grasping force was estimated from the lateral force and the unloading force from the bottom force. The protocol included eleven tasks with complementary constraints inspired by recent taxonomies: four tasks corresponding to lifting and holding the object with different grasp configurations, and seven to manipulating the object (rotation around each of its axis and translation). The grasping and unloading forces and object rotations were measured during the five phases of the actions: unloading, lifting, holding or manipulation, preparation to deposit, and deposit. The results confirm the tight regulation between grasping and unloading forces during lifting, and extend this to the deposit phase. In addition, they provide a precise description of the regulation of force exchanges during various manipulation tasks spanning representative actions of daily life. The timing of manipulation showed both sequential and overlapping organization of the different sub-actions, and micro-errors could be detected. This phenomenological study confirms the feasibility of using an instrumented object to investigate complex manipulative behavior in humans. This protocol will be used in the future to investigate upper-limb dexterity in patients with sensory-motor impairments.},

The action generator generates actions with regard to a goal vector in the manipulator joint space. Suitable goal vectors are provided by the DIV module. This module is based on the inversion of a neural network that has been previously trained to approximate the manipulator forward kinematics in polar coordinates. Results for two- and three-link planar manipulators are shown. These controllers achieve a good performance quite rapidly and exhibit good generalization capabilities in the face of new environments.},

However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.},

A generic assembly strategy suitable for execution on an industrial robot is selected by the programmer. Parameters are then self-tuned empirically by the robot using a genetic-algorithm learning process that seeks to minimize assembly time subject to contact-force limits. Results are presented for two automotive part assembly examples using ABB robots with commercial force-control software, showing that the approach is highly effective and suitable for industrial use.},

  abstract = {With the undeniable rapid development of Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering has become an obligatory skill for effective communication and interaction with language driven tools like ChatGPT. It can be leveraged in enforcing rules and process automation for ensuring good quality and quantity of output from LLMs. Moreover, the order of providing examples within prompts, automatic instruction generation, and selection methods has been proven to significantly impact the performance of LLMs. Prompts can be optimized to maximize a chosen score function by searching a pool of instruction candidates within LLMs. No wonder automatically generated instructions give better or similar performance than human annotated instructions and outperform baselines of LLMs, this makes prompt engineering a programming procedure for customizing outputs and interactions of LLMs. In this chapter, we provide thorough understanding of prompt engineering, latest prompt engineering techniques with relevant exercises for putting the techniques in practice. We also discuss current and future trends of LLMs and prompt engineering research, including the rise of automatic instruction generation and selection methods. These are very important for prompt and NLP engineers, conversational AI researchers, and all information seekers or users of LLMs and prompt engineering tools in sensitive domains like health care, security, education~among others.~The chapter provides indepth understanding of prompt engineering principles and techniques for responsible coversational AI.},

  abstract = {Modern deep neural network training is typically based on mini-batch stochastic gradient optimization. While the use of large mini-batches increases the available computational parallelism, small batch training has been shown to provide improved generalization performance and allows a significantly smaller memory footprint, which might also be exploited to improve machine throughput. In this paper, we review common assumptions on learning rate scaling and training duration, as a basis for an experimental comparison of test performance for different mini-batch sizes. We adopt a learning rate that corresponds to a constant average weight update per gradient calculation (i.e., per unit cost of computation), and point out that this results in a variance of the weight updates that increases linearly with the mini-batch size \$m\$. The collected experimental results for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show that increasing the mini-batch size progressively reduces the range of learning rates that provide stable convergence and acceptable test performance. On the other hand, small mini-batch sizes provide more up-to-date gradient calculations, which yields more stable and reliable training. The best performance has been consistently obtained for mini-batch sizes between \$m = 2\$ and \$m = 32\$, which contrasts with recent work advocating the use of mini-batch sizes in the thousands.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success across many domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components through pretraining. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI. Therefore, it is imperative to capture the evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach for surgical phase recognition using video data, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of surgical procedures for automated workflow analysis. The advent of robotic surgery, digitized operating rooms, and the generation of vast amounts of data have opened doors for the application of machine learning and computer vision in the analysis of surgical videos. Among these advancements, Surgical Phase Recognition(SPR) stands out as an emerging technology that has the potential to recognize and assess the ongoing surgical scenario, summarize the surgery, evaluate surgical skills, offer surgical decision support, and facilitate medical training. In this paper, we analyse and evaluate both frame-based and video clipping-based phase recognition on thoracic surgery dataset consisting of 11 classes of phases. Specifically, we utilize ImageNet ViT for image-based classification and VideoMAE as the baseline model for video-based classification. We show that Masked Video Distillation(MVD) exhibits superior performance, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 72.9\%, compared to 52.31\% achieved by ImageNet ViT. These findings underscore the efficacy of video-based classifiers over their image-based counterparts in surgical phase recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {Path planning of autonomous mobile robots in a real-world environment presents several challenges which are usually not raised in other areas. The real world is inherently complex, uncertain and dynamic. Therefore, accurate models of path planning are difficult to obtain and quickly become outdated. Anytime planners are ideal for this type of problem as they can find an initial solution very quickly and then improve it as time allows. This paper proposes a new anytime incremental search algorithm named improved Anytime Dynamic A*(iADA*). The algorithm is based on the currently popular anytime heuristic search algorithm, which is Anytime Dynamic A*(ADA*). The iADA* algorithm improves the calculation of the path lengths and decreases the calculating frequency of the path throughout the search, making it significantly faster. The algorithm is designed to provide an efficient solution to a complex, dynamic search environment when the locally changes affected. Our study shows that the two-dimensional path-planning iADA* experiments were between 2.0 to 3.7 times faster than ADA*, both in partially known and fully unknown dynamic environments. Additionally, in this paper shows the experiment results of the comparison with other four existing algorithms based on computing time and path lengths. iADA* was an average 2.57 times reduced on the computational time for the environment which locally changes effected. For the path length is little increase, but it is not the worst case. According to the experiments, the more the environmental problems and complexity increases, the more iADA* provides a rapid in-search time and total time to obtain the final solution.},

  abstract = {In modern industrial settings with small batch sizes it should be easy to set up a robot system for a new task. Strategies exist, e.g. the use of skills, but when it comes to handling forces and torques, these systems often fall short. We introduce an approach that provides a combination of task-level planning with targeted learning of scenario-specific parameters for skill-based systems. We propose the following pipeline: (1) the user provides a task goal in the planning language PDDL, (2) a plan (i.e., a sequence of skills) is generated and the learnable parameters of the skills are automatically identified. An operator then chooses (3) reward functions and hyperparameters for the learning process. Two aspects of our methodology are critical: (a) learning is tightly integrated with a knowledge framework to support symbolic planning and to provide priors for learning, (b) using multi-objective optimization. This can help to balance key performance indicators (KPIs) such as safety and task performance since they can often affect each other. We adopt a multi-objective Bayesian optimization approach and learn entirely in simulation. We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our approach by learning skill parameters for two different contact-rich tasks. We show their successful execution on a real 7-DOF KUKA-iiwa manipulator and outperform the manual parameterization by human robot operators.},

Motivated by these successes, researchers have begun to apply CNNs to the resolution of inverse problems such as denoising, deconvolution, super-resolution, and medical image reconstruction, and they have started to report improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including sparsity-based techniques such as compressed sensing. Here, we review the recent experimental work in these areas, with a focus on the critical design decisions: Where does the training data come from? What is the architecture of the CNN? and How is the learning problem formulated and solved? We also bring together a few key theoretical papers that offer perspective on why CNNs are appropriate for inverse problems and point to some next steps in the field.},

  abstract = {1 Overview RPL (Reactive Plan Language) 1 belongs to the family of notations for writing reactive plans for agents RAP notation. Many of Firby's concepts have been carried over, but there are some diierences: (1) The syntax is more {\textbackslash}recursive," more in the style of Lisp (2) More high-level concepts (interrupts, monitors) have been made into explicit constructs. (3) The interpreter does not attempt to maintain a world model that tracks the situation outside the robot. RPL is being applied to high-level robot planning, and to representing advisory plans for emergency situations (McDermott et al. 1991). A RPL plan looks like a Lisp program. (Indeed, I will use the terms {\textbackslash}plan" and {\textbackslash}program" interchangeably .) A plan consists of a set of procedure calls, of the form (f \{args\{), glued together with syntactic constructs like (SEQ \{steps\{), (IF condition act true act false), and the like. Variable bindings in RPL are lexically scoped. But Lisp global variables can be accessed, too. There are special facilities for binding variables to the tasks created by the plan itself. Any Lisp procedure can be called from a RPL plan. In addition, RPL procedures can deened using (DEF-INTERP-PROC name (\{formals\{) \{body\{) There are no local procedures (i.e., no LABELS). RPL looks so much like Lisp that many Lisp programs are valid RPL plans. However, the intent is not to encourage users to think of plans as typical computer programs, whose operation hinges on the maintenance of complex datastructures. RPL plans are intended to spell out how the behavior of an agent is to be driven by events around it, and to do so in a notation so transparent that a planner can reason about how well the plans will work. A key mechanism to achieve these aims is the idea of a uent, or time-varying quantity. Of course, all program variables are time-varying quantities, but in plans we want behavior to be governed by the temporal changes. For example, in RPL we can say (FILTER c e) to mean, {\textbackslash}Execute e while the uent 1 Thanks to Mark Drummond and Sean Engelson for comments on previous drafts of this paper.\vphantom{\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}}}

  abstract = {Key challenges for the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real world are the discovery, representation and reuse of skills in the absence of a reward function. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn a task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view videos. Our method learns a general skill embedding independently from the task context by using an adversarial loss. We combine a metric learning loss, which utilizes temporal video coherence to learn a state representation, with an entropy regularized adversarial skill-transfer loss. The metric learning loss learns a disentangled representation by attracting simultaneous viewpoints of the same observations and repelling visually similar frames from temporal neighbors. The adversarial skill-transfer loss enhances re-usability of learned skill embeddings over multiple task domains. We show that the learned embedding enables training of continuous control policies to solve novel tasks that require the interpolation of previously seen skills. Our extensive evaluation with both simulation and real world data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in learning transferable skills from unlabeled interaction videos and composing them for new tasks.

By doing so, we do not require any prototype updating, we can handle any training size, and the output dimensionality is no longer constrained to the number of classes. Furthermore, we generalize to regression, by optimizing outputs as an interpolation between two prototypes on the hypersphere. Since both tasks are now defined by the same loss function, they can be jointly trained for multi-task problems. Experimentally, we show the benefit of hyperspherical prototype networks for classification, regression, and their combination over other prototype methods, softmax cross-entropy, and mean squared error approaches.},

Due to a high number of variants in this field, an automated placement by special machines is often not economically feasible. The resulting manual process is characterized by monotony, ergonomic strain and high labor cost. As a result, a partial automation, using lightweight robots in hybrid assembly system, yields high potential. The lower stiffness and resulting accuracy deficiency of lightweight robots compared to common industrial robots, combined with the precision requirements and inherent fragility of the devices, prohibits the deployment of such systems. In this contribution, a scalable setup and strategies for visual and force-torque guided tactile insertion of such devices is presented and evaluated. A library, based on a system for the offline-programming of such tasks, is used to decrease implementation efforts. A performance evaluation of the system on printed circuit boards with multiple different devices is conducted.},

  abstract = {Autonomous robots are being used increasingly in safety-critical environments. Due to their dynamic nature and uncertainty, failures of low-level actions are common. In plan-based robotics, these failures are handled inside the higher-level plans, using a multitude of failure handling strategies. With the increasing complexity of robotic plans, failures may be accidentally left unhandled. This will usually stop the plan entirely. To avoid such a situation, the failure handling should ideally be complete, i.e. there should be no failure that can reach the top-level of the execution. In this paper, we propose to use formal methods, in particular symbolic fault injection to tackle the problem of finding unhandled failures or proving that no such failure exists. We implement symbolic fault injection for the CRAM Planning Language (CPL). We base our work on the worst-case assumption that any low-level action may fail at any time with any of its possible types of failure. Our work builds upon an existing symbolic execution engine for CPL and extends it to reason about CPL's failure handling mechanism. We also present a way to implement the worst-case assumption directly into CPL. Our experimental evaluation suggests that symbolic fault injection is a suitable and scalable method to find unhandled failures in robotic plans.},

  abstract = {Increasing the size of a neural network typically improves accuracy but also increases the memory and compute requirements for training the model. We introduce methodology for training deep neural networks using half-precision floating point numbers, without losing model accuracy or having to modify hyper-parameters. This nearly halves memory requirements and, on recent GPUs, speeds up arithmetic. Weights, activations, and gradients are stored in IEEE half-precision format. Since this format has a narrower range than single-precision we propose three techniques for preventing the loss of critical information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step (this copy is rounded to half-precision for the forward- and back-propagation). Secondly, we propose loss-scaling to preserve gradient values with small magnitudes. Thirdly, we use half-precision arithmetic that accumulates into single-precision outputs, which are converted to half-precision before storing to memory. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology works across a wide variety of tasks and modern large scale (exceeding 100 million parameters) model architectures, trained on large datasets.},

Two pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures for computer vision tasks ResNet-50 and Google's recently proposed, EfficientNet-B0, were fine-tuned for the classification task on the HAM10000 dataset. The dataset comprises 10015 dermatoscopic images belonging to seven classes of skin cancer melanocytic nevus, melanoma, benign keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, vascular lesions, and dermatofibroma. The aim of the study was to establish how well the EfficientNet family of models (which result in up to 8.4{\texttimes}{\texttimes}{\textbackslash}times parameter reduction and 16{\texttimes}{\texttimes}{\textbackslash}times FLOPS reduction) transfers to the skin classification task in comparison with the ResNet architecture. Overall, it was found that the EfficientNet-B0 model, with fewer parameters, outperformed the ResNet-50 model. EfficientNet-B0 model produced better ROC AUC values for each classification category and also achieved higher macro and micro averaged AUC values for the overall classification, 0.93 and 0.97, respectively (in comparison with, 0.91 and 0.96 of the ResNet-50 model).},

We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis.}

  abstract = {Recent work in deep reinforcement learning (RL) has produced algorithms capable of mastering challenging games such as Go, chess, or shogi. In these works the RL agent directly observes the natural state of the game and controls that state directly with its actions. However, when humans play such games, they do not just reason about the moves but also interact with their physical environment. They understand the state of the game by looking at the physical board in front of them and modify it by manipulating pieces using touch and fine-grained motor control. Mastering complicated physical systems with abstract goals is a central challenge for artificial intelligence, but it remains out of reach for existing RL algorithms. To encourage progress towards this goal we introduce a set of physically embedded planning problems and make them publicly available. We embed challenging symbolic tasks (Sokoban, tic-tac-toe, and Go) in a physics engine to produce a set of tasks that require perception, reasoning, and motor control over long time horizons. Although existing RL algorithms can tackle the symbolic versions of these tasks, we find that they struggle to master even the simplest of their physically embedded counterparts. As a first step towards characterizing the space of solution to these tasks, we introduce a strong baseline that uses a pre-trained expert game player to provide hints in the abstract space to an RL agent's policy while training it on the full sensorimotor control task. The resulting agent solves many of the tasks, underlining the need for methods that bridge the gap between abstract planning and embodied control.},

Unlike adversarial training, our method defines the adversarial direction without label information and is hence applicable to semi-supervised learning. Because the directions in which we smooth the model are only "virtually" adversarial, we call our method virtual adversarial training (VAT). The computational cost of VAT is relatively low. For neural networks, the approximated gradient of virtual adversarial loss can be computed with no more than two pairs of forward- and back-propagations. In our experiments, we applied VAT to supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks on multiple benchmark datasets. With a simple enhancement of the algorithm based on the entropy minimization principle, our VAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning tasks on SVHN and CIFAR-10.},

Additionally, it creates hazards for the workers as it may result in many deadly respiratory diseases. Robotic polishing is the solution to these problems. It can improve productivity, eliminate the defects, and provides consistent product quality. In this paper, an effective approach is presented for the robotic polishing of the complex curved surfaces. The key part of the presented method is the tool path planning with controlled force and polishing parameters optimization evaluated using design of experiments (DOE). The tool path planning is aimed at improving the surface quality and the contact area per path. The constraints of joint limits and productivity are also considered. Moreover, its jerk avoidance strategy allows the robot to move swiftly while ensuring a smooth trajectory. The presented method is verified for the polishing of an eyeglass frame. A considerable improvement of 90\% on the average roughness is achieved with the maximum acceptable roughness set at 0.02 \&micro;m. The polishing operation takes just 79 secs and the average glossiness of 76 G is achieved on the final product along with the successful elimination of scratches on the surface.},

End-to-end learning systems based on deep learning require passing gradients across component boundaries.Typical software implementations of forward kinematics are not differentiable, and thus prevent the construction of gradient-based, end-to-end learning systems. In this paper we present a library compatible with ROS-URDF that computes forward kinematics while simultaneously giving access to the gradients w.r.t. joint configurations and model parameters, allowing gradient-based learning and model identification. Our Python library is based on Tensorflow{\textasciitilde}2 and is auto-differentiable. It supports calculating a large number of kinematic configurations on the GPU in parallel, yielding a considerable performance improvement compared to sequential CPU-based calculation. https://github.com/lumoe/dlkinematics.git},

  abstract = {Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning lays out methods for humans and machines to work together effectively.Summary Most machine learning systems that are deployed in the world today learn from human feedback. However, most machine learning courses focus almost exclusively on the algorithms, not the human-computer interaction part of the systems. This can leave a big knowledge gap for data scientists working in real-world machine learning, where data scientists spend more time on data management than on building algorithms. Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning is a practical guide to optimizing the entire machine learning process, including techniques for annotation, active learning, transfer learning, and using machine learning to optimize every step of the process.  Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.  About the technology Machine learning applications perform better with human feedback.

  abstract = {Autonomous learning of robotic skills can allow general-purpose robots to learn wide behavioral repertoires without requiring extensive manual engineering. However, robotic skill learning methods typically make one of several trade-offs to enable practical real-world learning, such as requiring manually designed policy or value function representations, initialization from human-provided demonstrations, instrumentation of the training environment, or extremely long training times. In this paper, we propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for learning manipulation skills that can train general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. Our approach builds on the guided policy search (GPS) algorithm, which transforms the reinforcement learning problem into supervised learning from a computational teacher (without human demonstrations). In contrast to prior GPS methods, which require a consistent set of initial states to which the system must be reset after each episode, our approach can handle randomized initial states, allowing it to be used in environments where deterministic resets are impossible. We compare our method to existing policy search techniques in simulation, showing that it can train high-dimensional neural network policies with the same sample efficiency as prior GPS methods, and present real-world results on a PR2 robotic manipulator.},

In this paper, with the goal of improving the performance exhibited by RL algorithms, we explore a systematic way of leveraging the additional information provided by an emerging class of differentiable simulators. Building on concepts established by Deterministic Policy Gradients (DPG) methods, the neural network policies learned with our approach represent deterministic actions. In a departure from standard methodologies, however, learning these policies does not hinge on approximations of the value function that must be learned concurrently in an actor-critic fashion. Instead, we exploit differentiable simulators to directly compute the analytic gradient of a policy's value function with respect to the actions it outputs. This, in turn, allows us to efficiently perform locally optimal policy improvement iterations. Compared against other state-of-the-art RL methods, we show that with minimal hyper-parameter tuning our approach consistently leads to better asymptotic behavior across a set of payload manipulation tasks that demand a high degree of accuracy and precision.},

Meanwhile, their inherent sample efficiency warrants utility for most robot applications, limiting potential damage to the robot and its environment during training. Inspired by information theoretic model predictive control and advances in deep reinforcement learning, we introduce Model Predictive Actor-Critic (MoPAC), a hybrid model-based/model-free method that combines model predictive rollouts with policy optimization as to mitigate model bias. MoPAC leverages optimal trajectories to guide policy learning, but explores via its model-free method, allowing the algorithm to learn more expressive dynamics models. This combination guarantees optimal skill learning up to an approximation error and reduces necessary physical interaction with the environment, making it suitable for real-robot training. We provide extensive results showcasing how our proposed method generally outperforms current state-of-the-art and conclude by evaluating MoPAC for learning on a physical robotic hand performing valve rotation and finger gaiting--a task that requires grasping, manipulation, and then regrasping of an object.},

Leakage from an intestinal anastomosis can be disastrous, resulting in prolonged hospital stays and increased risk of mortality. To minimize the risk of potential complications, it is important to create a tension-free join with good apposition of the bowel edges in the presence of an excellent blood supply. This review discusses the factors that influence intestinal anastomotic healing, the various technical operations for creating anastomoses, and operative techniques currently used in constructing anastomoses. Tables review the principles of successful intestinal anastomosis, consequences of postoperative dehiscence, factors linked with dehiscence, anastomotic techniques ranked by best blood flow to the healing site, comparison of hand and stapled techniques, leak rates from the Rectal Cancer Trial on Defunctioning Stoma and the Contant and colleagues mechanical bowel obstruction trial, leak and wound infection rates from mechanical bowel obstruction meta-analyses, diseases and systemic factors associated with poor anastomotic healing, lifestyle-associated leakage rates, salvage after anastomotic leakage, standard checks for creation of anastomoses, and steps for left-sided stapled colorectal anastomoses for cancer. Figures show the phases of wound healing, the tissue layers of the jejunum, interrupted and continuous suture techniques, stitches commonly used in fashioning intestinal anastomoses, double-layer end-to-end anastomosis, traction sutures, anatomic relations between the colon and the retroperitoneal organs, single-layer sutured side-to-side enteroenterostomy, Finney strictureplasty, double-layer sutured end-to-side enterocolostomy, double-stapled end-to-end coloanal anastomosis, use of a ``glove'' port in laparoscopic surgery, and perfusion assessment at the time of anastomotic creation.

Aside from control, humans can also be involved in the learning process in other ways. In curriculum learning human domain experts try to impose some structure on the examples presented to improve the learning; in explainable AI the focus is on the ability of the model to explain to humans why a given solution was chosen.

Our contribution is not merely listing the different approaches, but to provide definitions clarifying confusing, varied and sometimes contradictory terms; to elucidate and determine the boundaries between the different methods; and to correlate all the techniques searching for the connections and influences between them.},

For that reason, we developed the extensible Robotics API for programming industrial robots on top of a general-purpose language. Although being a very flexible approach to programming industrial robots, a fully-fledged language can be too complex for simple tasks. Additionally, legacy support for code written in the original DSL has to be maintained. For these reasons, we present a lightweight implementation of a typical robotic DSL, the KUKA Robot Language (KRL), on top of our Robotics API. This work deals with the challenges in reverse-engineering the language and mapping its specifics to the Robotics API. We introduce two different approaches of interpreting and executing KRL programs: tree-based and bytecode-based interpretation.},

We then detail how motion planning problems can be formulated as probabilistic inference on a factor graph. This forms the basis for GPMP2, a very efficient algorithm that combines GP representations of trajectories with fast, structure-exploiting inference via numerical optimization. Finally, we extend GPMP2 to an incremental algorithm, iGPMP2, that can efficiently replan when conditions change. We benchmark our algorithms against several samplingbased and trajectory optimization-based motion planning algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that GPMP2 is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. We also benchmark iGPMP2 on replanning problems, and show that it can find successful solutions in a fraction of the time required by GPMP2 to replan from scratch.},

We describe how saliency measures can be made more efficient by exploiting Saliency Map Order Equivalence. We visualize individual scale/layer contributions by using a Layer Ordered Visualization of Information. This provides an interesting comparison of scale information contributions within the network not provided by other saliency map methods. Using our method instead of Guided Backprop, coarse-resolution class activation methods such as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ seem to yield demonstrably superior results without sacrificing speed. This will make fine-resolution saliency methods feasible on resource limited platforms such as robots, cell phones, low-cost industrial devices, astronomy and satellite imagery.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces PyRobot, an open-source robotics framework for research and benchmarking. PyRobot is a light-weight, high-level interface on top of ROS that provides a consistent set of hardware independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. PyRobot abstracts away details about low-level controllers and inter-process communication, and allows non-robotics researchers (ML, CV researchers) to focus on building high-level AI applications. PyRobot aims to provide a research ecosystem with convenient access to robotics datasets, algorithm implementations and models that can be used to quickly create a state-of-the-art baseline. We believe PyRobot, when paired up with low-cost robot platforms such as LoCoBot, will reduce the entry barrier into robotics, and democratize robotics. PyRobot is open-source, and can be accessed via https://pyrobot.org.},

  abstract = {Based on a scenario where humans and robots share their workspace, a system for automatically error handling during an automated industrial assembly is presented. If an error occurs, it is first detected and then classified. If it is a previously unknown error, the human closest to the robot will be asked to perform error handling by interacting with the robot. This interaction is recorded so that it can be reapplied if the same error occurs again. If the error is already known, an appropriate error handling is selected and applied without any further human interaction required. Thus, the interaction rate decreases over time and the system learns to handle more and more errors independently. In addition, it is presented how different recorded error handlings can be optimized according to given performance criteria. For this purpose, a suitable input device for performing the error handling is required first. In addition, the Hierarchical Decomposition (HD) is introduced as the abstract representation of an assembly operation. In this case, an assembly is subdivided into different states at multiple hierarchical levels. This is done by a domain export which also defines conditions for state transition. Thus, the HD allows assembly progress monitoring, error detection and classification as well as error prediction. A strategy presentation is introduced to store and reuse demonstrated error handling interactions. One particular feature of this representation is that a strategy is always related to the robot's end-effector pose at that point of time when an error occurs. Thus, a strategy describes the movements which have been performed for error handling. The strategy's invariance against rotation or translation allows significant reduction in the amount of strategies needed to be demonstrated by a human via interaction. Four selection criteria are introduced in order to decide if a strategy matches an error. Thereby, it is possible to make a selection based on one criterion or to perform a multi-criteria optimization using all available information. By introducing a strategy optimization approach, the overall system performance can be improved.  In a subsequent experiment, it is shown that the presented error handling approach can be successfully applied.},

  abstract = {Our goal is for robots to follow natural language instructions like ``put the towel next to the microwave.'' But getting large amounts of labeled data, i.e. data that contains demonstrations of tasks labeled with the language instruction, is prohibitive. In contrast, obtaining policies that respond to image goals is much easier, because any autonomous trial or demonstration can be labeled in hindsight with its final state as the goal. In this work, we contribute a method that taps into joint image- and goal- conditioned policies with language using only a small amount of language data. Prior work has made progress on this using vision-language models or by jointly training language-goal-conditioned policies, but so far neither method has scaled effectively to real-world robot tasks without significant human annotation. Our method achieves robust performance in the real world by learning an embedding from the labeled data that aligns language not to the goal image, but rather to the desired change between the start and goal images that the instruction corresponds to. We then train a policy on this embedding: the policy benefits from all the unlabeled data, but the aligned embedding provides an *interface* for language to steer the policy. We show instruction following across a variety of manipulation tasks in different scenes, with generalization to language instructions outside of the labeled data.},

  abstract = {Point set registration is a key component in many computer vision tasks. The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {While reinforcement learning provides an appealing formalism for learning individual skills, a general-purpose robotic system must be able to master an extensive repertoire of behaviors. Instead of learning a large collection of skills individually, can we instead enable a robot to propose and practice its own behaviors automatically, learning about the affordances and behaviors that it can perform in its environment, such that it can then repurpose this knowledge once a new task is commanded by the user? In this paper, we study this question in the context of self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. A central challenge in this learning regime is the problem of goal setting: in order to practice useful skills, the robot must be able to autonomously set goals that are feasible but diverse. When the robot's environment and available objects vary, as they do in most open-world settings, the robot must propose to itself only those goals that it can accomplish in its present setting with the objects that are at hand. Previous work only studies self-supervised goal-conditioned RL in a single-environment setting, where goal proposals come from the robot's past experience or a generative model are sufficient. In more diverse settings, this frequently leads to impossible goals and, as we show experimentally, prevents effective learning. We propose a conditional goal-setting model that aims to propose goals that are feasible from the robot's current state. We demonstrate that this enables self-supervised goal-conditioned off-policy learning with raw image observations in the real world, enabling a robot to manipulate a variety of objects and generalize to new objects that were not seen during training.},

Learning based approaches have shown promise in producing robust policies, but require heavy supervision to efficiently learn precise control, especially from visual inputs. We propose a novel self-supervision technique that uses time-reversal to learn goals and provide a high level plan to reach them. In particular, we introduce the time-reversal model (TRM), a self-supervised model which explores outward from a set of goal states and learns to predict these trajectories in reverse. This provides a high level plan towards goals, allowing us to learn complex manipulation tasks with no demonstrations or exploration at test time. We test our method on the domain of assembly, specifically the mating of tetris-style block pairs. Using our method operating atop visual model predictive control, we are able to assemble tetris blocks on a physical robot using only uncalibrated RGB camera input, and generalize to unseen block pairs. sites.google.com/view/time-reversal},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are among the most successful artificial intelligence technologies making impact in a variety of practical applications. However, many concerns were raised about the `magical' power of these networks. It is disturbing that we are really lacking of understanding of the decision making process behind this technology. Therefore, a natural question is whether we can trust decisions that neural networks make. One way to address this issue is to define properties that we want a neural network to satisfy. Verifying whether a neural network fulfills these properties sheds light on the properties of the function that it represents. In this tutorial, we overview several approaches to verifying neural networks properties. The first set of methods encode neural networks into Integer Linear Programs or Satisfiability Modulo Theory formulas. They come up with domain-specific algorithms to solve verification problems. The second approach is to treat the neural network as a non-linear function and to use global optimization techniques for verification. The third line of work uses abstract interpretation to certify neural networks. Finally, we consider a special class of neural networks - Binarized Neural Networks - that can be represented and analyzed using Boolean Satisfiability. We discuss how we can take advantage of the structure of neural networks in the search procedure.},

The notion of symbol so defined is internal to this concept, so it becomes a hypothesis that this notion of symbols includes the symbols that we humans use every day of our lives. In this paper we attempt systematically, but plainly, to lay out the nature of physical symbol systems. Such a review is in ways familiar, but not thereby useless. Restatement of fundamentals is an important exercise.The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or the U.S. Government.Herb Simon would be a co-author of this paper, except that he is giving his own paper at this conference.

In this position paper, we examine the technical difficulty of fine-tuning hypothetical AGI systems based on pretrained deep models to pursue goals that are aligned with human interests. We argue that, if trained like today's most capable models, AGI systems could learn to act deceptively to receive higher reward, learn internally-represented goals which generalize beyond their fine-tuning distributions, and pursue those goals using power-seeking strategies. We review emerging evidence for these properties. AGIs with these properties would be difficult to align and may appear aligned even when they are not.},

Such modelling provides an explicit representation of a task through its task-theme mixture. We present an efficient approximation inference technique based on variational inference method for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We perform empirical evaluations to validate the task uncertainty and task distance produced by the proposed method through correlation diagrams of the prediction accuracy on testing tasks.

We analyze a family of algorithms for learning a parameter initialization that can be fine-tuned quickly on a new task, using only first-order derivatives for the meta-learning updates. This family includes and generalizes first-order MAML, an approximation to MAML obtained by ignoring second-order derivatives. It also includes Reptile, a new algorithm that we introduce here, which works by repeatedly sampling a task, training on it, and moving the initialization towards the trained weights on that task. We expand on the results from Finn et al. showing that first-order meta-learning algorithms perform well on some well-established benchmarks for few-shot classification, and we provide theoretical analysis aimed at understanding why these algorithms work.},

However, these methods often require expert data for learning, which limits their application to scenarios where data generation is time-consuming. Recent developments have also led to physics-informed deep neural models capable of representing complex dynamical Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Inspired by these developments, we propose Neural Time Fields (NTFields) for robot motion planning in cluttered scenarios. Our framework represents a wave propagation model generating continuous arrival time to find path solutions informed by a nonlinear first-order PDE called Eikonal Equation. We evaluate our method in various cluttered 3D environments, including the Gibson dataset, and demonstrate its ability to solve motion planning problems for 4-DOF and 6-DOF robot manipulators where the traditional grid-based Eikonal planners often face the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, the results show that our method exhibits high success rates and significantly lower computational times than the state-of-the-art methods, including NMPs that require training data from classical planners.},

These problems appear in various scenarios ranging from object manipulation to legged-robot locomotion. However, the zero-volume nature of manifolds makes the CMP problem challenging, and the state-of-the-art methods still take several seconds to find a path and require a computationally expansive path dataset for imitation learning. Recently, physics-informed motion planning methods have emerged that directly solve the Eikonal equation through neural networks for motion planning and do not require expert demonstrations for learning. Inspired by these approaches, we propose the first physics-informed CMP framework that solves the Eikonal equation on the constraint manifolds and trains neural function for CMP without expert data. Our results show that the proposed approach efficiently solves various CMP problems in both simulation and real-world, including object manipulation under orientation constraints and door opening with a high-dimensional 6-DOF robot manipulator. In these complex settings, our method exhibits high success rates and finds paths in sub-seconds, which is many times faster than the state-of-the-art CMP methods.},

  abstract = {In distributed and decentralized state estimation systems, fusion methods are employed to systematically combine multiple estimates of the state into a single, more accurate estimate. An often encountered problem in the fusion process relates to unknown common information that is shared by the estimates to be fused and is responsible for correlations. If the correlation structure is unknown to the fusion method, conservative strategies are typically pursued. As such, the parameterization introduced by the ellipsoidal intersection method has been a novel approach to describe unknown correlations, though suitable values for these parameters with proven consistency have not been identified yet. In this article, an extension of ellipsoidal intersection is proposed that guarantees consistent fusion results in the presence of unknown common information. The bound used by the novel approach corresponds to computing an outer ellipsoidal bound on the intersection of inverse covariance ellipsoids. As a major advantage of this inverse covariance intersection method, fusion results prove to be more accurate than those provided by the well-known covariance intersection method.}

The language metaphor entered modern computing as part of a cybernetic discourse, but during the second half of the 1950s acquired a more abstract meaning, closely related to the formal languages of logic and linguistics. The article argues that this transformation was related to the appearance of the commercial computer in the mid-1950s. Managers of computing installations and specialists on computer programming in academic computer centers, confronted with an increasing variety of machines, called for the creation of "common" or "universal languages" to enable the migration of computer code from machine to machine. Finally, the article shows how the idea of a universal language was a decisive step in the emergence of programming languages, in the recognition of computer programming as a proper field of knowledge, and eventually in the way we think of the computer.},

Domain-specific modeling promises an efficient and flexible concept for developing robotics applications that copes with this challenge.

Furthermore, it focuses on increasing the level of automation, e.g. through code generation, to bridge the gap between the modeling and the implementation levels and to improve the efficiency and quality of the software development process. Within this contribution, we survey the literature available on domain-specific (modeling) languages in robotics required to realize a state-of-the-art real-world example from the RoboCup@Work competition. We classify 41 publications in the field as reference for potential DSL users. Furthermore, we analyze these contributions from a DSL-engineering viewpoint and discuss quantitative and qualitative aspects such as the methods and tools used for DSL implementation as well as their documentation status and platform integration. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for discussion in the robotics programming and simulation community based on the insights gained with this survey.},

Humans can do this, often learning systematic rules from very few examples, and combining these rules to form compositional rule-based systems. Current neural architectures, on the other hand, often fail to generalize in a compositional manner, especially when evaluated in ways that vary systematically from training. In this work, we present a neuro-symbolic model which learns entire rule systems from a small set of examples. Instead of directly predicting outputs from inputs, we train our model to induce the explicit system of rules governing a set of previously seen examples, drawing upon techniques from the neural program synthesis literature. Our rule-synthesis approach outperforms neural meta-learning techniques in three domains: an artificial instructionlearning domain used to evaluate human learning, the SCAN challenge datasets, and learning rulebased translations of number words into integers for a wide range of human languages.},

Interpreting such underspecified instructions requires environmental context and background knowledge about how to accomplish complex tasks. Further, the robot's workspace knowledge may be incomplete: the environment may only be partially-observed or background knowledge may be missing causing a failure in plan synthesis. We introduce a probabilistic model that utilizes background knowledge to infer latent or missing plan constituents based on semantic co-associations learned from noisy textual corpora of task descriptions. The ability to infer missing plan constituents enables information-seeking actions such as visual exploration or dialogue with the human to acquire new knowledge to fill incomplete plans.

  author = {O'Hara, Stephen and Draper, Bruce A.},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {The past decade has seen the growing popularity of Bag of Features (BoF) approaches to many computer vision tasks, including image classification, video search, robot localization, and texture recognition. Part of the appeal is simplicity. BoF methods are based on orderless collections of quantized local image descriptors; they discard spatial information and are therefore conceptually and computationally simpler than many alternative methods. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, BoF-based systems have set new performance standards on popular image classification benchmarks and have achieved scalability breakthroughs in image retrieval. This paper presents an introduction to BoF image representations, describes critical design choices, and surveys the BoF literature. Emphasis is placed on recent techniques that mitigate quantization errors, improve feature detection, and speed up image retrieval. At the same time, unresolved issues and fundamental challenges are raised. Among the unresolved issues are determining the best techniques for sampling images, describing local image features, and evaluating system performance. Among the more fundamental challenges are how and whether BoF methods can contribute to localizing objects in complex images, or to associating high-level semantics with natural images. This survey should be useful both for introducing new investigators to the field and for providing existing researchers with a consolidated reference to related work.}

The network includes both system dynamics and cost models, used for optimal control based planning. PI-Net is fully differentiable, learning both dynamics and cost models end-to-end by back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent. Because of this, PI-Net can learn to plan. PI-Net has several advantages: it can generalize to unseen states thanks to planning, it can be applied to continuous control tasks, and it allows for a wide variety learning schemes, including imitation and reinforcement learning. Preliminary experiment results show that PI-Net, trained by imitation learning, can mimic control demonstrations for two simulated problems; a linear system and a pendulum swing-up problem. We also show that PI-Net is able to learn dynamics and cost models latent in the demonstrations.},

A new challenge in this respect is to equip robots with cognitive capabilities, in order to make them able to act autonomously and cooperate with human surgeons. In this paper we describe the methodological approach developed to comprehensively describe a specific surgical knowledge, to be transferred to a complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrating Perception, Cognitive and Planning modules. Starting from desk researches and a strict cooperation with expert surgeons, the surgical process is framed on a high-level perspective, which is then deepened into a granular model through a Surgical Process Modelling approach, so as to embed all of the needed information by the AI to properly work. The model is eventually completed adding the corresponding Process Risk Analysis. We present the results obtained with the application of the aforementioned methodology to a Laparoscopic Radical Nephrectomy (LRN) procedure and discuss on the next technical implementation of this model.},

Consequently, they are often equipped with external sensors capable of perceiving the environment (e.g., cameras) and the contacts that may arise (e.g. force/torque sensors). This letter proposes a general framework for combining force and visual information in the visual feature space. By leveraging recent results on the derivation of visual servo dynamics, we generalize the treatment regardless of the visual features chosen. Vision and force sensing are coupled in the feature space, avoiding both the convergence to a local minimum and the arising of inconsistencies at the actuation level. Any task space direction is simultaneously controlled by both vision and force. Compliance against interaction forces is achieved in feature space along the features defining the visual task. Experiments on a real platform are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

To relax the resulting programming effort, a knowledge-enabled approach to robot programming can be adopted to organize information in re-usable knowledge pieces. However, for the ease of re-use, there needs to be an agreement on the meaning of terms. A common approach is to represent these terms using ontology languages that conceptualize the respective domain. In this work, we will review projects that use ontologies to support robot autonomy. We will systematically search for projects that fulfill a set of inclusion criteria, and compare them with each other with respect to the scope of their ontology, what types of cognitive capabilities are supported by the use of ontologies, and which is their application domain.},

Hence, trustworthy robots must be able to store, retrieve and narrate important knowledge about their collaborations and adaptations. In this article, it is proposed a sound methodology that integrates three main elements. First, an ontology for collaborative robotics and adaptation to model the domain knowledge. Second, an episodic memory for time-indexed knowledge storage and retrieval. Third, a novel algorithm to extract the relevant knowledge and generate textual explanatory narratives. The algorithm produces three different types of outputs, varying the specificity, for diverse uses and preferences. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the narratives, obtaining promising results. Finally, we discuss how the methodology can be generalized to other ontologies and experiences. This work boosts robot explainability, especially in cases where robots need to narrate the details of their short and long-term past experiences.},

  abstract = {Large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets have shown remarkable successes on efficiently tackling downstream applications. In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train "generalist" X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms.

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales.

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.},

  abstract = {Existing motion planning methods often have two drawbacks: (1) goal configurations need to be specified by a user, and (2) only a single solution is generated under a given condition. In practice, multiple possible goal configurations exist to achieve a task. Although the choice of the goal configuration significantly affects the quality of the resulting trajectory, it is not trivial for a user to specify the optimal goal configuration. In addition, the objective function used in the trajectory optimization is often non-convex, and it can have multiple solutions that achieve comparable costs. In this study, we propose a framework that determines multiple trajectories that correspond to the different modes of the cost function. We reduce the problem of identifying the modes of the cost function to that of estimating the density induced by a distribution based on the cost function. The proposed framework enables users to select a preferable solution from multiple candidate trajectories, thereby making it easier to tune the cost function and obtain a satisfactory solution. We evaluated our proposed method with motion planning tasks in 2D and 3D space. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm is capable of determining multiple solutions for those tasks.},

However, existing methods are restricted to learning efficient representations of static scenes that encode all scene objects into a single neural network, and they lack the ability to represent dynamic scenes and decompose scenes into individual objects. In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that represents multi-object dynamic scenes as scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformations and radiance, allowing us to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe similar objects with a single implicit function. We assess the proposed method on synthetic and real automotive data, validating that our approach learns dynamic scenes -- only by observing a video of this scene -- and allows for rendering novel photo-realistic views of novel scene compositions with unseen sets of objects at unseen poses.},

  abstract = {This paper presents novel Gaussian process decentralized data fusion algorithms exploiting the notion of agent-centric support sets for distributed cooperative perception of large-scale environmental phenomena. To overcome the limitations of scale in existing works, our proposed algorithms allow every mobile sensing agent to choose a different support set and dynamically switch to another during execution for encapsulating its own data into a local summary that, perhaps surprisingly, can still be assimilated with the other agents' local summaries (i.e., based on their current choices of support sets) into a globally consistent summary to be used for predicting the phenomenon. To achieve this, we propose a novel transfer learning mechanism for a team of agents capable of sharing and transferring information encapsulated in a summary based on a support set to that utilizing a different support set with some loss that can be theoretically bounded and analyzed. To alleviate the issue of information loss accumulating over multiple instances of transfer learning, we propose a new information sharing mechanism to be incorporated into our algorithms in order to achieve memory-efficient lazy transfer learning. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets show that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through a language model API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

The goal of the present study is to evaluate the strength at failure and the failure mechanism for 3D-printed transtibial sockets, thermoplastic transtibial check sockets, and carbon-fiber definitive laminated transtibial sockets. Materials and Methods Three clinically available materials (carbon fiber, PETG thermoplastic, and 3D print polylactic acid [PLA]) were used to produce identically shaped sockets. In final assembly, the carbon-fiber sockets were designed for use both with and without a pin-lock system. Thermoplastic sockets and 3D-printed sockets were designed for use without a pin-lock system. These socket systems were then tested following International Standards Organization (ISO) 10328. Ultimate strength (US) at failure, maximum deflection at failure, and failure mechanism were determined. Results Both designs of carbon-fiber sockets had higher US values at failure than thermoplastic sockets and 3D-printed PLA sockets. Thermoplastic sockets had a slightly higher average US than 3D-printed sockets, but 3D-printed sockets exhibited a greater strength-to-weight ratio. Four distinct socket failure mechanisms were determined. Conclusions Failure mechanisms and US values differed for all socket types. Carbon-fiber sockets exhibited the highest US, but 3D-printed PLA sockets showed comparable strength to current thermoplastic sockets. Although the ISO 10328 testing standard was sufficient to complete these evaluations, the method lacked some socket-specific measures and loading conditions that could have improved comparisons between socket types.}

  abstract = {Robotic systems may frequently come across similar manipulation planning problems that result in similar motion plans. Instead of planning each problem from scratch, it is preferable to leverage previously computed motion plans, i.e., experiences, to ease the planning. Different approaches have been proposed to exploit prior information on novel task instances. These methods, however, rely on a vast repertoire of experiences and fail when none relates closely to the current problem. Thus, an open challenge is the ability to generalise prior experiences to task instances that do not necessarily resemble the prior. This work tackles the above challenge with the proposition that experiences are "decomposable" and "malleable", i.e., parts of an experience are suitable to relevantly explore the connectivity of the robot-task space even in non-experienced regions. Two new planners result from this insight: experience-driven random trees (ERT) and its bi-directional version ERTConnect. These planners adopt a tree sampling-based strategy that incrementally extracts and modulates parts of a single path experience to compose a valid motion plan. We demonstrate our method on task instances that significantly differ from the prior experiences, and compare with related state-of-the-art experience-based planners. While their repairing strategies fail to generalise priors of tens of experiences, our planner, with a single experience, significantly outperforms them in both success rate and planning time. Our planners are implemented and freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library.},

  abstract = {Reward hacking---where RL agents exploit gaps in misspecified proxy rewards---has been widely observed, but not yet systematically studied. To understand reward hacking, we construct four RL environments with different misspecified rewards. We investigate reward hacking as a function of agent capabilities: model capacity, action space resolution, and observation space noise. Typically, more capable agents are able to better exploit reward misspecifications, causing them to attain higher proxy reward and lower true reward. Moreover, we find instances of {\textbackslash}emph\{phase transitions\}: capability thresholds at which the agent's behavior qualitatively shifts, leading to a sharp decrease in the true reward. Such phase transitions pose challenges to monitoring the safety of ML systems. To encourage further research on reward misspecification, address this, we propose an anomaly detection task for aberrant policies and offer several baseline detectors.},

  abstract = {Smart robotics will be a core feature while migrating from Industry 3.0 (i.e., mass manufacturing) to Industry 4.0 (i.e., customized or social manufacturing). A key characteristic of a smart system is its ability to learn. For smart manufacturing, this means incorporating learning capabilities into the current fixed, repetitive, task-oriented industrial manipulators, thus rendering them `smart'. In this paper we introduce two reinforcement learning (RL) based compensation methods. The learned correction signal, which compensates for unmodeled aberrations, is added to the existing nominal input with an objective to enhance the control performance. The proposed learning algorithms are evaluated on a 6-DoF industrial robotic manipulator arm to follow different kinds of reference paths, such as square or a circular path, or to track a trajectory on a three dimensional surface. In an extensive experimental study we compare the performance of our learning-based methods with well-known tracking controllers, namely, proportional-derivative (PD), model predictive control (MPC), and iterative learning control (ILC). The experimental results show a considerable performance improvement thanks to our RL-based methods when compared to PD, MPC, and ILC.},

To this end, the semantic object maps can answer queries such as the following ones: ``What do parts of the kitchen look like?'', ``How can a container be opened and closed?'', ``Where do objects of daily use belong?'', ``What is inside of cupboards/drawers?'', etc. The semantic object maps presented in this article, which we call SOM+, extend the first generation of SOMs presented by Rusu et al. [1] in that the representation of SOM+ is designed more thoroughly and that SOM+ also include knowledge about the appearance and articulation of furniture objects. Also, the acquisition methods for SOM+ substantially advance those developed in [1] in that SOM+ are acquired autonomously and with low-cost (Kinect) instead of very accurate (laser-based) 3D sensors. In addition, perception methods are more general and are demonstrated to work in different kitchen environments.},

  abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

  abstract = {Shortening product development cycles and fully customisable products pose major challenges for production systems. These not only have to cope with an increased product diversity but also enable high throughputs and provide a high adaptability and robustness to process variations and unforeseen incidents. To overcome these challenges, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been increasingly applied for the optimisation of production systems. Unlike other machine learning methods, deep RL operates on recently collected sensor-data in direct interaction with its environment and enables real-time responses to system changes. Although deep RL is already being deployed in production systems, a systematic review of the results has not yet been established. The main contribution of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners an overview of applications and to motivate further implementations and research of deep RL supported production systems. Findings reveal that deep RL is applied in a variety of production domains, contributing to data-driven and flexible processes. In most applications, conventional methods were outperformed and implementation efforts or dependence on human experience were reduced. Nevertheless, future research must focus more on transferring the findings to real-world systems to analyse safety aspects and demonstrate reliability under prevailing conditions.},

  abstract = {Movement Primitives (MP) are a well-established approach for representing modular and re-usable robot movement generators. Many state-of-the-art robot learning successes are based MPs, due to their compact representation of the inherently continuous and high dimensional robot movements. A major goal in robot learning is to combine multiple MPs as building blocks in a modular control architecture to solve complex tasks. To this effect, a MP representation has to allow for blending between motions, adapting to altered task variables, and co-activating multiple MPs in parallel. We present a probabilistic formulation of the MP concept that maintains a distribution over trajectories. Our probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of new operations which are essential for implementing all aforementioned properties in one framework. In order to use such a trajectory distribution for robot movement control, we analytically derive a stochastic feedback controller which reproduces the given trajectory distribution. We evaluate and compare our approach to existing methods on several simulated as well as real robot scenarios.}

Nonetheless, popular tasks such as speech or images recognition, involve multi-dimensional input features that are characterized by strong internal dependencies between the dimensions of the input vector. We propose a novel quaternion recurrent neural network (QRNN), alongside with a quaternion long-short term memory neural network (QLSTM), that take into account both the external relations and these internal structural dependencies with the quaternion algebra. Similarly to capsules, quaternions allow the QRNN to code internal dependencies by composing and processing multidimensional features as single entities, while the recurrent operation reveals correlations between the elements composing the sequence. We show that both QRNN and QLSTM achieve better performances than RNN and LSTM in a realistic application of automatic speech recognition. Finally, we show that QRNN and QLSTM reduce by a maximum factor of 3.3x the number of free parameters needed, compared to real-valued RNNs and LSTMs to reach better results, leading to a more compact representation of the relevant information.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen the proposal of a number of neural architectures for the problem of Program Induction. Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the RecursiveReverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.},

We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user.

  abstract = {In this paper we explore few-shot imitation learning for control problems, which involves learning to imitate a target policy by accessing a limited set of offline rollouts. This setting has been relatively under-explored despite its relevance to robotics and control applications. State-of-the-art methods developed to tackle few-shot imitation rely on meta-learning, which is expensive to train as it requires access to a distribution over tasks (rollouts from many target policies and variations of the base environment). Given this limitation we investigate an alternative approach, fine-tuning, a family of methods that pretrain on a single dataset and then fine-tune on unseen domain-specific data. Recent work has shown that fine-tuners outperform meta-learners in few-shot image classification tasks, especially when the data is out-of-domain. Here we evaluate to what extent this is true for control problems, proposing a simple yet effective baseline which relies on two stages: (i) training a base policy online via reinforcement learning (e.g. Soft Actor-Critic) on a single base environment, (ii) fine-tuning the base policy via behavioral cloning on a few offline rollouts of the target policy. Despite its simplicity this baseline is competitive with meta-learning methods on a variety of conditions and is able to imitate target policies trained on unseen variations of the original environment. Importantly, the proposed approach is practical and easy to implement, as it does not need any complex meta-training protocol. As a further contribution, we release an open source dataset called iMuJoCo (iMitation MuJoCo) consisting of 154 variants of popular OpenAI-Gym MuJoCo environments with associated pretrained target policies and rollouts, which can be used by the community to study few-shot imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning.},

During the past years, the landscape of HRL research has grown profoundly, resulting in copious approaches. A comprehensive overview of this vast landscape is necessary to study HRL in an organized manner. We provide a survey of the diverse HRL approaches concerning the challenges of learning hierarchical policies, subtask discovery, transfer learning, and multi-agent learning using HRL. The survey is presented according to a novel taxonomy of the approaches. Based on the survey, a set of important open problems is proposed to motivate the future research in HRL. Furthermore, we outline a few suitable task domains for evaluating the HRL approaches and a few interesting examples of the practical applications of HRL in the Supplementary Material.},

The language specifies motions, provides force and touch control and is capable of interacting with external vision systems. A model of the manipulator is maintained to translate positions in rectangular co-ordinates into joint angles and to predict joint inertias and gravity loads. Programming is interpretative and uses a PDP-10 computer running under time-sharing.

However, their relevance to the study~of language more broadly remains unclear. This article considers the potential of LLMs to serve as models of language understanding in humans. While debate on this question typically centres around models' performance on challenging language understanding tasks, this article argues that the answer depends on models' underlying competence, and thus that the focus of the debate should be on empirical work which seeks to characterize the representations and processing algorithms that underlie model behaviour. From this perspective, the article offers counterarguments to two commonly cited reasons why LLMs cannot serve as plausible models of language in humans: their lack of symbolic structure and their lack of grounding. For each, a case is made that recent empirical trends undermine the common assumptions about LLMs, and thus that it is premature to draw conclusions about LLMs' ability (or lack thereof) to offer insights on human language representation and understanding.

We use reinforcement learning to find deep neural networks representing both low-level control policies and task-level ``option policies'' that achieve high-level goals. Our combined architecture generates safe and responsive motion plans that respect the LTL constraints. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated autonomous driving setting, where a vehicle must drive down a road in traffic, avoid collisions, and navigate an intersection, all while obeying rules of the road.},

However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises. In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the robots to perform a variety of tasks, through the use of simple task-level programming methods. We demonstrate various approaches to this, extensively tested with several people inexperienced in robotics. We validate our findings through several deployments of the complete robot system in running production facilities at an industrial partner. It follows from these experiments that the use of robot skills, and associated task-level programming framework, is a viable solution to introducing robots that can intuitively and on the fly be programmed to perform new tasks by factory workers.},

  abstract = {In this letter, we propose an approach to trajectory planning based on the purpose of the task. For a redundant manipulator, many end effector poses in the task space can be achieved with multiple joint configurations. In planning the motion, we are free to choose the configuration that is optimal for the particular task requirement. Many previous motion planning approaches have been proposed for the sole purpose of maximizing manipulability, or minimizing effort. However, there is a lack of formulation that is flexible enough to allow the designer to purposefully define the motion and force priority of the planned trajectory. Our approach exploits both velocity and force manipulability, depending on the purpose of the task. In this formulation, the purpose of the task is defined by the motion preference (``fast'' or ``strong''), which can be characterized by a direction of the desired motion, or force. These two directions can be used to evaluate the compatibility of a chosen configuration with the given task. We first demonstrate the possibility of generating two distinct motion plans by the kinematic alignment of desired velocity and force directions with the manipulator's velocity and force manipulability ellipses. Next, this configuration selection strategy is incorporated into a task-specific trajectory optimization formulation to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. Two distinct motions (force-oriented lifting motion and velocity-oriented ballistic motion) are planned. We also propose a blending method to generate a single motion plan that considers both force and velocity, each to a specified degree. Together the three motions (force, velocity, and blended) are successfully planned and executed on a three-link serial robotic manipulator. The letter concludes with discussion and future directions.},

A key question of cognition-enabled and AI-driven robotics is how to organize and manage such data and knowledge efficiently in a cognitive robot control architecture. We argue, that memory is a central active component of such architectures that mediates between semantic and sensorimotor representations, orchestrates the flow of data streams and events between different processes and provides the components of a cognitive architecture with data-driven services for learning semantics from sensorimotor data, the parametrization of symbolic plans for execution and prediction of action effects. Based on related work, and the experience gained in developing our ARMAR humanoid robot systems, we identified conceptual and technical requirements of a memory system as central component of cognitive robot control architecture that facilitate the realization of high-level cognitive abilities such as explaining, reasoning, prospection, simulation and augmentation. Conceptually, a memory should be active, support multi-modal data representations, associate knowledge, be introspective, and have an inherently episodic structure. Technically, the memory should support a distributed design, be access-efficient and capable of long-term data storage. We introduce the memory system for our cognitive robot control architecture and its implementation in the robot software framework ArmarX. We evaluate the efficiency of the memory system with respect to transfer speeds, compression, reproduction and prediction capabilities. {$\bullet$} Memory-based and hybrid robot cognitive architecture {$\bullet$} Memory as mediator between semantic and sensorimotor representations {$\bullet$} Conceptual and technical requirements for the memory {$\bullet$} Implementation in the robot software framework ArmarX},

  abstract = {The advent of the Industry 4.0 initiative has made it so that manufacturing environments are becoming more and more dynamic, connected but also inherently more complex, with additional inter-dependencies, uncertainties and large volumes of data being generated. Recent advances in Industrial Artificial Intelligence have showcased the potential of this technology to assist manufacturers in tackling the challenges associated with this digital transformation of Cyber-Physical Systems, through its data-driven predictive analytics and capacity to assist decision-making in highly complex, non-linear and often multistage environments. However, the industrial adoption of such solutions is still relatively low beyond the experimental pilot stage, as real environments provide unique and difficult challenges for which organizations are still unprepared. The aim of this paper is thus two-fold. First, a systematic review of current Industrial Artificial Intelligence literature is presented, focusing on its application in real manufacturing environments to identify the main enabling technologies and core design principles. Then, a set of key challenges and opportunities to be addressed by future research efforts are formulated along with a conceptual framework to bridge the gap between research in this field and the manufacturing industry, with the goal of promoting industrial adoption through a successful transition towards a digitized and data-driven company-wide culture. This paper is among the first to provide a clear definition and holistic view of Industrial Artificial Intelligence in the Industry 4.0 landscape, identifying and analysing its fundamental building blocks and ongoing trends. Its findings are expected to assist and empower researchers and manufacturers alike to better understand the requirements and steps necessary for a successful transition into Industry 4.0 supported by AI, as well as the challenges that may arise during this process.},

This eliminates the need to extract the task parameters, by directly utilizing the camera image during the motion reproduction.

While existing approaches for task-parameterized skill learning have demonstrated good adaptation within the demonstrated region, the extrapolation problem of task-parameterized skills has not been investigated enough. In this work, with the aim of good adaptation not only within the demonstrated region but also outside of the region, we propose to combine a generative model with a dynamic movement primitive by formulating learning as a density estimation problem. Moreover, for efficient learning from relatively few demonstrations, we propose to augment training data with additional incomplete data. The proposed method is tested and compared with existing works in simulations and real robot experiments. Experimental results verified its generalization in the extrapolation region.},

It focuses on reducing the required expertise in robotics to a level that allows shop floor workers to use robots in their application domain without the need of extensive training. Our approach is user-centric and can interpret underspecified robot tasks, enabling communication on an abstract level. Such high-level task descriptions make the system amenable for users that are experts in a particular domain, but have limited knowledge about robotics and are thus not able to specify low-level details and instructions. Semantic models for all involved entities, i.e., processes, workpieces, and workcells, enable automatic reasoning about underspecified tasks and missing pieces of information. We showcase and evaluate this methodology on two industrial use cases from the domains of assembly and woodworking, comparing it to state-of-the-art solutions provided by robot manufacturers.},

  abstract = {Zero-shot and in-context learning enable solving tasks without model fine-tuning, making them essential for developing generative model solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether a pretrained model can be prompted to approximate any function, i.e., whether it is a universal in-context approximator. While it was recently shown that transformer models do possess this property, these results rely on their attention mechanism. Hence, these findings do not apply to fully recurrent architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and the increasingly popular SSMs. We demonstrate that RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Linear RNNs, and linear gated architectures such as Mamba and Hawk/Griffin can also serve as universal in-context approximators. To streamline our argument, we introduce a programming language called LSRL that compiles to these fully recurrent architectures. LSRL may be of independent interest for further studies of fully recurrent models, such as constructing interpretability benchmarks. We also study the role of multiplicative gating and observe that architectures incorporating such gating (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Hawk/Griffin) can implement certain operations more stably, making them more viable candidates for practical in-context universal approximation.},

In this paper we exploit such advances by tailoring the ontology learning problem as a transductive reasoning task that learns to convert knowledge from natural language to a logic-based specification. More precisely, using a sample of definitory sentences generated starting by a synthetic grammar, we trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures to extract OWL formulae from text. In addition to the low feature engineering costs, our system shows good generalisation capabilities over the lexicon and the syntactic structure. The encouraging results obtained in the paper provide a first evidence of the potential of deep learning techniques towards long term ontology learning challenges such as improving domain independence, reducing engineering costs, and dealing with variable language forms.},

Based on a model leveraging the Technology, Organisation, and Environment (TOE) framework, this work examines the adoption of InRos in ACMCs in the context of an emerging economy. This research scrutinises the adoption intention and potential use of InRos in ACMCs through a survey of 460 senior managers and owners of ACMCs in India. The findings indicate that perceived compatibility, external pressure, perceived benefits and support from vendors are critical predictors of InRos adoption intention. Interestingly, the study also reveals that IT infrastructure and government support do not influence InRos adoption intention. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that perceived cost issues negatively moderate the relationship between the adoption intention and potential use of InRos in ACMCs. This study offers a theoretical contribution as it deploys the traditional TOE framework and discovers counter-intuitively that IT resources are not a major driver of technology adoption: as such, it suggests that a more comprehensive framework than the traditional RBV should be adopted. The work provides managerial recommendations for managers, shedding light on the antecedents of adoption intention and potential use of InRos at ACMCs in a country where the adoption of InRos is in a nascent stage.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is a topic of considerable current interest. The availability of massive data collections and powerful software resources has led to an impressive amount of results in many application areas that reveal essential but hidden properties of the observations. System identification learns mathematical descriptions of dynamic systems from input-output data and can thus benefit from the advances of deep neural networks to enrich the possible range of models to choose from. For this reason, we provide a survey of deep learning from a system identification perspective. We cover a wide spectrum of topics to enable researchers to understand the methods, providing rigorous practical and theoretical insights into the benefits and challenges of using them. The main aim of the identified model is to predict new data from previous observations. This can be achieved with different deep learning based modelling techniques and we discuss architectures commonly adopted in the literature, like feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent networks. Their parameters have to be estimated from past data trying to optimize the prediction performance. For this purpose, we discuss a specific set of first-order optimization tools that is emerged as efficient. The survey then draws connections to the well-studied area of kernel-based methods. They control the data fit by regularization terms that penalize models not in line with prior assumptions. We illustrate how to cast them in deep architectures to obtain deep kernel-based methods. The success of deep learning also resulted in surprising empirical observations, like the counter-intuitive behaviour of models with many parameters. We discuss the role of overparameterized models, including their connection to kernels, as well as implicit regularization mechanisms which affect generalization, specifically the interesting phenomena of benign overfitting ...},

The proposed setup uses three models to: a) Identify gaps in understanding automatically during live conversational interactions, b) Learn the respective interpretations of such unknown concepts from live interactions with users, and c) Manage a classroom sub-dialogue specifically tailored for interactive teaching sessions.

We propose to learn reward functions from both the robot and the human perspectives to improve on both efficiency metrics. Learning a reward function from the human perspective increases feedback efficiency by assuming that humans rank trajectories according to a low-dimensional outcome space. Learning a reward function from the robot perspective circumvents the need for a dynamics model while retaining the sample efficiency of model-based approaches. We provide an algorithm that incorporates bi-perspective reward learning into a general hierarchical reinforcement learning framework and demonstrate the merits of our approach on a toy task and a simulated robot grasping task.},

Yet in practice, we often assume the existence of a particular reward model, without regard to its potential shortcomings. In this preliminary work, I survey several failure modes of learned reward models, which may be organized into three broad categories: model misspecification, ambiguous preferences, and reward misgeneralization.

The ability to detect the structure of new actions, to learn them and to select on the fly the proper one given the current task set is one great leap in infants cognition. This behavior is an important component of the child's ability of learning-to-learn, a mechanism akin to the one of intrinsic motivation that is argued to drive cognitive development. Accordingly, we propose to model a dual system based on (1) the learning of new task sets and on (2) their evaluation relative to their uncertainty and prediction error. The architecture is designed as a two-level-based neural system for context-dependent behavior (the first system) and task exploration and exploitation (the second system). In our model, the task sets are learned separately by reinforcement learning in the first network after their evaluation and selection in the second one. We perform two different experimental setups to show the sensorimotor mapping and switching between tasks, a first one in a neural simulation for modeling cognitive tasks and a second one with an arm-robot for motor task learning and switching. We show that the interplay of several intrinsic mechanisms drive the rapid formation of the neural populations with respect to novel task sets.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers have achieved many successes in image classification in recent years. It has been consistently demonstrated that best practice for image classification is when large deep models can be trained on abundant labelled data. However there are many real world scenarios where the requirement for large amounts of training data to get the best performance cannot be met. In these scenarios transfer learning can help improve performance. To date there have been no surveys that comprehensively review deep transfer learning as it relates to image classification overall. However, several recent general surveys of deep transfer learning and ones that relate to particular specialised target image classification tasks have been published. We believe it is important for the future progress in the field that all current knowledge is collated and the overarching patterns analysed and discussed. In this survey we formally define deep transfer learning and the problem it attempts to solve in relation to image classification. We survey the current state of the field and identify where recent progress has been made. We show where the gaps in current knowledge are and make suggestions for how to progress the field to fill in these knowledge gaps. We present a new taxonomy of the applications of transfer learning for image classification. This taxonomy makes it easier to see overarching patterns of where transfer learning has been effective and, where it has failed to fulfill its potential. This also allows us to suggest where the problems lie and how it could be used more effectively. We show that under this new taxonomy, many of the applications where transfer learning has been shown to be ineffective or even hinder performance are to be expected when taking into account the source and target datasets and the techniques used.},

One possible approach is to introduce combinatorial building blocks into neural networks. Such end-to-end architectures have the potential to tackle combinatorial problems on raw input data such as ensuring global consistency in multi-object tracking or route planning on maps in robotics. In this work, we present a method that implements an efficient backward pass through blackbox implementations of combinatorial solvers with linear objective functions. We provide both theoretical and experimental backing. In particular, we incorporate the Gurobi MIP solver, Blossom V algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm into architectures that extract suitable features from raw inputs for the traveling salesman problem, the min-cost perfect matching problem and the shortest path problem.},

  abstract = {Convolutional networks are ubiquitous in deep learning. They are particularly useful for images, as they reduce the number of parameters, reduce training time, and increase accuracy. However, as a model of the brain they are seriously problematic, since they require weight sharing - something real neurons simply cannot do. Consequently, while neurons in the brain can be locally connected (one of the features of convolutional networks), they cannot be convolutional. Locally connected but non-convolutional networks, however, significantly underperform convolutional ones. This is troublesome for studies that use convolutional networks to explain activity in the visual system. Here we study plausible alternatives to weight sharing that aim at the same regularization principle, which is to make each neuron within a pool react similarly to identical inputs. The most natural way to do that is by showing the network multiple translations of the same image, akin to saccades in animal vision. However, this approach requires many translations, and doesn't remove the performance gap. We propose instead to add lateral connectivity to a locally connected network, and allow learning via Hebbian plasticity. This requires the network to pause occasionally for a sleep-like phase of "weight sharing". This method enables locally connected networks to achieve nearly convolutional performance on ImageNet and improves their fit to the ventral stream data, thus supporting convolutional networks as a model of the visual stream.}

  abstract = {When manipulating a novel object with complex dynamics, a state representation is not always available, for example for deformable objects. Learning both a representation and dynamics from observations requires large amounts of data. We propose Learned Visual Similarity Predictive Control (LVSPC), a novel method for data-efficient learning to control systems with complex dynamics and high-dimensional state spaces from images. LVSPC leverages a given simple model approximation from which image observations can be generated. We use these images to train a perception model that estimates the simple model state from observations of the complex system online. We then use data from the complex system to fit the parameters of the simple model and learn where this model is inaccurate, also online. Finally, we use Model Predictive Control and bias the controller away from regions where the simple model is inaccurate and thus where the controller is less reliable. We evaluate LVSPC on two tasks; manipulating a tethered mass and a rope. We find that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods with an order of magnitude less data. LVSPC also completes the rope manipulation task on a real robot with 80\% success rate after only 10 trials, despite using a perception system trained only on images from simulation.},

Such methods assume Gaussian process (GP) models for both, the function and its gradient, and use them to construct an acquisition function that identifies the next query point. In this paper, we propose a class of practical FOBO algorithms that efficiently utilizes the information from the gradient GP to identify potential query points with zero gradients. We construct a multi-level acquisition function where in the first step, we optimize a lower level acquisition function with multiple restarts to identify potential query points with zero gradient value. We then use the upper level acquisition function to rank these query points based on their function values to potentially identify the global maximum. As a final step, the potential point of maximum is chosen as the actual query point. We validate the performance of our proposed algorithms on several test functions and show that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art FOBO algorithms. We also illustrate the application of our algorithms in finding optimal set of hyper-parameters in machine learning and in learning the optimal policy in reinforcement learning tasks.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has consistently surpassed other Machine Learning methods and achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple cases. Several modern applications like financial and recommender systems require models that are constantly updated with fresh data. The prominent approach for keeping a DL model fresh is to trigger full retraining from scratch when enough new data are available. However, retraining large and complex DL models is time-consuming and compute-intensive. This makes full retraining costly, wasteful, and slow. In this paper, we present an approach to continuously train and deploy DL models. First, we enable continuous training through proactive training that combines samples of historical data with new streaming data. Second, we enable continuous deployment through gradient sparsification that allows us to send a small percentage of the model updates per training iteration. Our experimental results with LeNet5 on MNIST and modern DL models on CIFAR-10 show that proactive training keeps models fresh with comparable---if not superior---performance to full retraining at a fraction of the time. Combined with gradient sparsification, sparse proactive training enables very fast updates of a deployed model with arbitrarily large sparsity, reducing communication per iteration up to four orders of magnitude, with minimal---if any---losses in model quality. Sparse training, however, comes at a price; it incurs overhead on the training that depends on the size of the model and increases the training time by factors ranging from 1.25 to 3 in our experiments. Arguably, a small price to pay for successfully enabling the continuous training and deployment of large DL models.},

Existing implementations of such an interface are considered, solutions for the internal structure design of the framework are proposed.

  abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), i.e., the development of more transparent and interpretable AI models, has gained increased traction over the last few years. This is due to the fact that, in conjunction with their growth into powerful and ubiquitous tools, AI models exhibit one detrimental characteristic: a performance-transparency trade-off. This describes the fact that the more complex a model's inner workings, the less clear it is how its predictions or decisions were achieved. But, especially considering Machine Learning (ML) methods like Reinforcement Learning (RL) where the system learns autonomously, the necessity to understand the underlying reasoning for their decisions becomes apparent. Since, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no single work offering an overview of Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) methods, this survey attempts to address this gap. We give a short summary of the problem, a definition of important terms, and offer a classification and assessment of current XRL methods. We found that a) the majority of XRL methods function by mimicking and simplifying a complex model instead of designing an inherently simple one, and b) XRL (and XAI) methods often neglect to consider the human side of the equation, not taking into account research from related fields like psychology or philosophy. Thus, an interdisciplinary effort is needed to adapt the generated explanations to a (non-expert) human user in order to effectively progress in the field of XRL and XAI in general.},

  abstract = {Cognitive theory has decomposed human mental abilities into cognitive (sub) systems, and cognitive neuroscience succeeded in disclosing a host of relationships between cognitive systems and specific structures of the human brain. However, an explanation of why specific functions are located in specific brain loci had still been missing, along with a neurobiological model that makes concrete the neuronal circuits that carry thoughts and meaning. Brain theory, in particular the Hebb-inspired neurocybernetic proposals by Braitenberg, now offers an avenue toward explaining brain--mind relationships and to spell out cognition in terms of neuron circuits in a neuromechanistic sense. Central to this endeavor is the theoretical construct of an elementary functional neuronal unit above the level of individual neurons and below that of whole brain areas and systems: the distributed neuronal assembly (DNA) or thought circuit (TC). It is shown that DNA/TC theory of cognition offers an integrated explanatory perspective on brain mechanisms of perception, action, language, attention, memory, decision and conceptual thought. We argue that DNAs carry all of these functions and that their inner structure (e.g., core and halo subcomponents), and their functional activation dynamics (e.g., ignition and reverberation processes) answer crucial localist questions, such as why memory and decisions draw on prefrontal areas although memory formation is normally driven by information in the senses and in the motor system. We suggest that the ability of building DNAs/TCs spread out over different cortical areas is the key mechanism for a range of specifically human sensorimotor, linguistic and conceptual capacities and that the cell assembly mechanism of overlap reduction is crucial for differentiating a vocabulary of actions, symbols and concepts.},

In the latter, the inference process is unrolled in time and interpreted as a recurrent neural network (RNN) which allows for joint learning of model and inference parameters with back-propagation through time. In this framework, the RNN architecture is directly derived from a hand-chosen inference algorithm, effectively limiting its capabilities. We propose a learning framework, called Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), in which we turn algorithm construction the other way round: Given data and a task, train an RNN to learn an inference algorithm. Because RNNs are Turing complete [1, 2] they are capable to implement any inference algorithm. The framework allows for an abstraction which removes the need for domain knowledge. We demonstrate in several image restoration experiments that this abstraction is effective, allowing us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image denoising and super-resolution tasks and superior across-task generalization.},

However, these learned features are hard to identify and interpret from a human vision perspective, causing a lack of understanding of the CNNs internal working mechanism. To improve the CNN interpretability, the CNN visualization is well utilized as a qualitative analysis method, which translates the internal features into visually perceptible patterns. And many CNN visualization works have been proposed in the literature to interpret the CNN in perspectives of network structure, operation, and semantic concept. In this paper, we expect to provide a comprehensive survey of several representative CNN visualization methods, including Activation Maximization, Network Inversion, Deconvolutional Neural Networks (DeconvNet), and Network Dissection based visualization. These methods are presented in terms of motivations, algorithms, and experiment results.

Using a mixed reality head-mounted display (Microsoft Hololens) and a 7-DOF robot arm, we designed an augmented reality (AR) robotic interface with four interactive functions to ease the robot programming task: 1) Trajectory specification. 2) Virtual previews of robot motion. 3) Visualization of robot parameters. 4) Online reprogramming during simulation and execution. We validate our AR-robot teaching interface by comparing it with a kinesthetic teaching interface in two different scenarios as part of a pilot study: creation of contact surface path and free space path. Furthermore, we present an industrial case study that illustrates our AR manufacturing paradigm by interacting with a 7-DOF robot arm to reduce wrinkles during the pleating step of the carbon-fiber-reinforcement-polymer vacuum bagging process in a simulated scenario.},

Our approach comprises the following components: i) constraint and environment perception encoders; ii) neural robot configuration generator that outputs configurations on/near the constraint manifold(s), and iii) a bidirectional planning algorithm that takes the generated configurations to create a feasible robot motion trajectory. We show that CoMPNet solves practical motion planning tasks involving both unconstrained and constrained problems. Furthermore, it generalizes to new unseen locations of the objects, i.e., not seen during training, in the given environments with high success rates. When compared to the state-of-the-art constrained motion planning algorithms, CoMPNet outperforms by order of magnitude improvement in computational speed with a significantly lower variance.},

Most of the new collaborative robot manipulators come with intuitive programming interfaces that allow novice users to compose robot programs and tune their parameters. However, parameters like motion speeds or exerted forces cannot be easily demonstrated and often require manual tuning, resulting in a tedious trial-and-error process. To address this problem, we formulate tuning of one-dimensional parameters as an Active Learning problem where the learner iteratively refines its estimate of the feasible range of parameter values, by selecting informative queries. By executing the parametrized actions, the learner gathers the user's feedback, in the form of directional answers ("higher,'' "lower,'' or "fine''), and integrates it in the estimate. We propose an Active Learning approach based on Expected Divergence Maximization for this setting and compare it against two baselines with synthetic data. We further compare the approaches on a real-robot dataset obtained from programs written with a simple Domain-Specific Language for a robot arm and manually tuned by expert users (N=8) to perform four manipulation tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness and usability of our interactive tuning approach against manual tuning with a user study where novice users (N=8) tuned parameters of a human-robot hand-over program.},

  abstract = {An important research direction in machine learning has centered around developing meta-learning algorithms to tackle few-shot learning. An especially successful algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a method that consists of two optimization loops, with the outer loop finding a meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can efficiently learn new tasks. Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains -- is the effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature reuse, with the meta initialization already containing high quality features? We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor. This leads to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of a MAML-trained network. ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm). We conclude with a discussion of the rapid learning vs feature reuse question for meta-learning algorithms more broadly.},

However, there are fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task specifications between natural image classification and the target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can perform comparably to ImageNet architectures. Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of the differences from transfer learning are due to the over-parametrization of standard models rather than sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more efficient model exploration. We also explore feature independent benefits of transfer arising from weight scalings.},

This allows the use of established calibration methods for the geometric influences captured in the kinematic model to improve the non-geometric error compensation by the neural network. The proposed approach is applied in two use cases: payload and wear compensation. Simulations and real experiments show the improved absolute accuracy of the hybrid compensation approach compared to classical calibration methods.},

This paper proposes a novel automatic path planning algorithm for robotic grinding and polishing tasks based on point clouds obtained directly by scanning the workpiece. The adaptive determination of the position and orientation of intersection planes as well as a slicing direction enables obtaining cross-sectional contours by slicing the point cloud. The algorithm generates a continuous, multidirectional path that has a meander shape precisely adapted to the workpiece surface. A qualitative analysis emphasises the robustness of the algorithm with respect to the distribution of the point cloud data and limited amount of noise.},

Greatest challenges are devising a suitable objective function that defines the task, and the high sample complexity of learning the task. We propose a novel active learning framework, consisting of decoupled task model and exploration components, which does not require an objective function. The task model is specific to a task and maps the parameter space, defining a trial, to the trial outcome space. The exploration component enables efficient search in the trial-parameter space to generate the subsequent most informative trials, by simultaneously exploiting all the information gained from previous trials and reducing the task model's overall uncertainty. We analyse the performance of our framework in a simulation environment and further validate it on a challenging bimanual-robot puck-passing task. Results show that the robot successfully acquires the necessary skills after only 100 trials without any prior information about the task or target positions. Decoupling the framework's components also enables efficient skill transfer to new environments which is validated experimentally.},

At the core, NeRF proposes that each 3D point can emit radiance, allowing to conduct view synthesis using differentiable volumetric rendering. While neural radiance fields can accurately represent 3D scenes for computing the image rendering, 3D meshes are still the main scene representation supported by most computer graphics and simulation pipelines, enabling tasks such as real time rendering and physics-based simulations. Obtaining 3D meshes from neural radiance fields still remains an open challenge since NeRFs are optimized for view synthesis, not enforcing an accurate underlying geometry on the radiance field. We thus propose a novel compact and flexible architecture that enables easy 3D surface reconstruction from any NeRF-driven approach. Upon having trained the radiance field, we distill the volumetric 3D representation into a Signed Surface Approximation Network, allowing easy extraction of the 3D mesh and appearance. Our final 3D mesh is physically accurate and can be rendered in real time on an array of devices.},

Related works have queried LLMs with a wide-range of contextual information, such as goals, sensor observations and scene descriptions, to generate high-level action plans for a specific task. In this work, we propose a prompting-based strategy for extracting executable plans from a LLM that leverages a novel and readily-accessible source of information: precondition errors. Our approach assumes that actions are only afforded execution in certain contexts (i.e. implicit preconditions must be met for an action to execute), and that the embodied agent has the ability to determine if the action is not executable in the current context (e.g: a precondition error is present). When an agent is unable to execute an action in a plan, our approach re-prompts the LLM with precondition error information to extract a useful and executable action to achieve the intended goal in the current context. We evaluate our approach in the VirtualHome simulation environment on 88 different tasks and 7 scenes. We evaluate different prompt templates and compare to methods that naively re-sample actions from the LLM. We find that our approach using precondition errors improves the executability and semantic correctness of plans, while also reducing the number of corrective re-prompts for querying actions.},

Such systems would be unlikely implemented on-line into a physical system, such as a robot, due to the pre-processing step(s) that those vision systems usually demand. In this work, we present and demonstrate that with an appropriate semantic representation of the activity, and without such complex perception systems, it is sufficient to infer human activities from videos. First, we will present a method to extract the semantic rules based on three simple hand motions, i.e. move, not move and tool use. Additionally, the information of the object properties either ObjectActedOn or ObjectInHand are used. Such properties encapsulate the information of the current context. The above data is used to train a decision tree to obtain the semantic rules employed by a reasoning engine. This means, we extract lower-level information from videos and we reason about the intended human behaviors (high-level). The advantage of the abstract representation is that it allows to obtain more generic models out of human behaviors, even when the information is obtained from different scenarios. The results show that our system correctly segments and recognizes human behaviors with an accuracy of 85\%. Another important aspect of our system is its scalability and adaptability toward new activities, which can be learned on-demand. Our system has been fully implemented on a humanoid robot, the iCub to experimentally validate the performance and the robustness of our system during on-line execution of the robot.},

We envision such rich scenarios can be used to train robots to learn new behaviors specially in human everyday activities where a diverse variability can be found. In this paper, we present a multi-level framework that is capable to use different input sources such as cameras and virtual environments to understand and execute the demonstrated activities. Our presented framework first obtains the semantic models of human activities from cameras, which are later tested using the SIGVerse virtual simulator to show new complex activities (such as, cleaning the table) using a virtual robot. Our introduced framework is integrated on a real robot, i.e. an iCub, which is capable to process the signals from the virtual environment to then understand the activities performed by the observed robot. This was realized through the use of previous knowledge and experiences that the robot has learned from observing humans activities. Our results show that our framework was able to extract the meaning of the observed motions with 80\% accuracy of recognition by obtaining the objects relationships given the current context via semantic representations to extract high-level understanding of those complex activities even when they represent different behaviors.},

  abstract = {In this study, we present a framework that infers human activities from observations using semantic representations. The proposed framework can be utilized to address the difficult and challenging problem of transferring tasks and skills to humanoid robots. We propose a method that allows robots to obtain and determine a higher-level understanding of a demonstrator's behavior via semantic representations. This abstraction from observations captures the ``essence'' of the activity, thereby indicating which aspect of the demonstrator's actions should be executed in order to accomplish the required activity. Thus, a meaningful semantic description is obtained in terms of human motions and object properties. In addition, we validated the semantic rules obtained in different conditions, i.e., three different and complex kitchen activities: 1) making a pancake; 2) making a sandwich; and 3) setting the table. We present quantitative and qualitative results, which demonstrate that without any further training, our system can deal with time restrictions, different execution styles of the same task by several participants, and different labeling strategies. This means, the rules obtained from one scenario are still valid even for new situations, which demonstrates that the inferred representations do not depend on the task performed. The results show that our system correctly recognized human behaviors in real-time in around 87.44\% of cases, which was even better than a random participant recognizing the behaviors of another human (about 76.68\%). In particular, the semantic rules acquired can be used to effectively improve the dynamic growth of the ontology-based knowledge representation. Hence, this method can be used flexibly across different demonstrations and constraints to infer and achieve a similar goal to that observed. Furthermore, the inference capability introduced in this study was integrated into a joint space control loop for a humanoid robot, an iCub, for achieving similar goals to the human demonstrator online.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present and demonstrate that with an appropriate semantic representation and even with a very naive perception system, it is sufficient to infer human activities from observations. First, we present a method to extract the semantic rules of human everyday activities. Namely, we extract low-level information from the sensor data and then we infer the high-level by reasoning about the intended human behaviors. The advantage of this abstract representation is that it allows us to obtain more generic models from human behaviors, even when the information is obtained from different scenarios. Another important aspect of our system is its scalability and adaptability toward new activities, which can be learned on-demand. Our system has been fully implemented on a humanoid robot, the iCub, to experimentally validate the performance and the robustness of our system during on-line execution within the control loop of the robot. The results show that the robot is able to make a decision in 0.12 s about the inferred human behaviors with a recognition accuracy of 85\%.}

This is important because, due to the tremendous advancement of the smartphone technology, it can be a powerful medium for speech emotion recognition in the outside laboratory natural environment, which is likely to incorporate background noise in the speech. We capitalize on the current breakthrough of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and seek to investigate its performance for emotion classification from noisy speech. We particularly focus on the recently proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is yet to be explored for emotion recognition from speech. Experiments conducted with speech compounded with eight different types of noises reveal that GRU incurs an 18.16\% smaller run-time while performing quite comparably to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is the most popular Recurrent Neural Network proposed to date. This result is promising for any embedded platform in general and will initiate further studies to utilize GRU to its full potential for emotion recognition on smartphones.},

However, grounding these plans in expansive, multi-floor, and multi-room environments presents a significant challenge for robotics. We introduce SayPlan, a scalable approach to LLM-based, large-scale task planning for robotics using 3D scene graph (3DSG) representations. To ensure the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs to allow LLMs to conduct a "semantic search" for task-relevant subgraphs from a smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an "iterative replanning" pipeline that refines the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 floors and 36 rooms with 140 assets and objects and show that our approach is capable of grounding large-scale, long-horizon task plans from abstract, and natural language instruction for a mobile manipulator robot to execute. We provide real robot video demonstrations on our project page https://sayplan.github.io.},

In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate ``narrow passages'' can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique converges over a wider range of input paths and is able to optimize higherorder dynamics of trajectories than previous path optimization strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Riemannian Motion Policy (RMP), a new mathematical object for modular motion generation. An RMP is a second-order dynamical system (acceleration field or motion policy) coupled with a corresponding Riemannian metric. The motion policy maps positions and velocities to accelerations, while the metric captures the directions in the space important to the policy. We show that RMPs provide a straightforward and convenient method for combining multiple motion policies and transforming such policies from one space (such as the task space) to another (such as the configuration space) in geometrically consistent ways. The operators we derive for these combinations and transformations are provably optimal, have linearity properties making them agnostic to the order of application, and are strongly analogous to the covariant transformations of natural gradients popular in the machine learning literature. The RMP framework enables the fusion of motion policies from different motion generation paradigms, such as dynamical systems, dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), optimal control, operational space control, nonlinear reactive controllers, motion optimization, and model predictive control (MPC), thus unifying these disparate techniques from the literature. RMPs are easy to implement and manipulate, facilitate controller design, simplify handling of joint limits, and clarify a number of open questions regarding the proper fusion of motion generation methods (such as incorporating local reactive policies into long-horizon optimizers). We demonstrate the effectiveness of RMPs on both simulation and real robots, including their ability to naturally and efficiently solve complicated collision avoidance problems previously handled by more complex planners.},

  abstract = {Industrial robots play a key role in production lines. As a direct consequence, even a slight degradation of their operating conditions could negatively affect the entire manufacturing process. To minimize economical losses, preventive measures such as planned maintenance or stand-by working stations are adopted and, in some cases, additional manipulators are installed to ensure line availability. However, since each robot performs a specific task, it degrades at a different rate from another one, so Planned Preventive Maintenance (PPM) should be replaced with Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) for a more efficient and cost-effective approach. In addition, collaborative robots (cobots) have become more and more popular in the past years increasing the level of automation, in particular in small and medium size companies. Therefore, a failure of an industrial manipulator could not only cause unexpected downtimes, but also jeopardize the safety of the personnel with whom it shares its workspace. A cobot, in fact, is labeled as safe as long as it works in nominal conditions, but this cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Within this framework, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) techniques could be used for both a customized maintenance on a specific machine and for preventing undesired events like the aforementioned ones. An ongoing research activity at Politecnico di Torino is focused on a model-based approach able to better describe the behavior of an industrial robot in non-nominal operating conditions. In order to properly simulate faults and failures of a manipulator, it has been first necessary to analyze its failure modes and their impact on the entire system. A robot, in fact, is usually equipped with internal sensors and algorithms able to monitor its health status. However, this is only true for software or electrical failures (i.e. power supply, motor or sensors related), but it is not as effective in case of mechanical ones like bearings or gearbox wear. This paper firstly presents an overview of the possible failures related to harmonic drives which are often used in robotics due to their compact and light-weight design and the high reduction ratio. Then, it outlines the work done with the objective of providing an accurate, physics-based description of faults progression of harmonic drives used in industrial robots and the related high-fidelity models in the framework of a PHM system for fault and failure detection, isolation and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction.},

NPI has three learnable components: a task-agnostic recurrent core, a persistent key-value program memory, and domain-specific encoders that enable a single NPI to operate in multiple perceptually diverse environments with distinct affordances. By learning to compose lower-level programs to express higher-level programs, NPI reduces sample complexity and increases generalization ability compared to sequence-tosequence LSTMs. The program memory allows efficient learning of additional tasks by building on existing programs. NPI can also harness the environment (e.g. a scratch pad with read-write pointers) to cache intermediate results of computation, lessening the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example sequences of calls to the immediate subprograms conditioned on the input. Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns from a small number of rich examples. We demonstrate the capability of our model to learn several types of compositional programs: addition, sorting, and canonicalizing 3D models. Furthermore, a single NPI learns to execute these programs and all 21 associated subprograms.},

  abstract = {In the past decades, more and more areas of human life have become influenced by networked cyber-physical systems (CPS). Increasingly, we trust these systems to execute critical functions, such as controlling our cars and airplanes and managing dangerous processes in factories and energy systems. Hence, these CPS have stringent safety, real-time, and security requirements. In this thesis, we consider CPS that are using Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) for communication. The IEEE 802.1 TSN standardization is developing a ``toolbox'' of many standards that extends Ethernet for safety-critical and real-time applications in several areas, e.g., automotive, aerospace, or industrial automation. TSN-based distributed CPS are composed of end-systems interconnected by network switches and duplex physical links; in TSN, communication streams from safety-critical and real-time applications can share the same communication channel with less-critical streams safely. However, the flexibility of TSN comes at the high price of a huge and poorly understood configuration space. TSN has many ``configuration knobs'', that decide, e.g., the real-time transmission of critical traffic via so-called Gate Control List (GCL) schedules, the stream priorities and their assignment to queues, and the routing of streams on disjoint paths to achieve fault-tolerance. Most TSN scheduling mechanisms are designed for homogeneous TSN networks, in which all network devices must have at least the TSN capabilities related to scheduled gates and time synchronization. However, this assumption is often unrealistic since many distributed applications use heterogeneous TSN networks with legacy or off-the shelf end-systems that are unscheduled and/or unsynchronized. In this thesis, we first propose a new scheduling paradigm for heterogeneous TSN networks that intertwines a network calculus worst-case interference analysis within the scheduling step. Thus, we support heterogeneous TSN networks featuring unscheduled and/or unsynchronized end-systems while guaranteeing the real-time properties of critical communication. Security is an important requirement in distributed CPS. We highlight the importance of addressing security at the same time with safety and timing requirements. We consider the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) low-resource multicast authentication protocol to guarantee the security requirements, and redundant disjunct message routes to tolerate link failures. Given a TSN-based distributed CPS, a set of applications with tasks and messages, as well as a set of security and redundancy requirements, in the second part of the thesis we are interested to synthesize a system configuration such that the real-time, safety, and security requirements are upheld. TSN is used within the computing continuum, from interconnecting IoT devices to the networks used in Edge Computing and Cloud Computing data centers. However, as systems become larger and more interconnected, the threat level increases and untrusted devices pose high security risks. Hence, in the final part of the thesis, we consider the use of Remote Attestation (RA) to authenticate the functionality of a remote device, thus, allowing for the provision of strong assurance guarantees. We propose solutions for the automatic management of resources in the IoT to Edge Computing continuum to integrate dynamic Edge applications with safety and security-critical real-time applications. We show that our approach generates dependable configurations that can meet the timing constraints of critical applications, have enough resources to perform RA for security, and can accommodate Edge applications. The configuration synthesis challenges tackled in the thesis form intractable combinatorial optimization problems. We have used a variety of optimization algorithms, from problem-specific heuristics to metaheuristics such as Simulated Annealing, and exact methods such as Constraint Programming, to tackle these problems. These approaches are evaluated on synthetic and realistic test cases of different sizes, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed and compared to the related work. The approaches proposed in the thesis have been implemented as open-source software prototypes and have been validated via simulations.}

  abstract = {State estimation of dynamical systems in real-time is a fundamental task in signal processing. For systems that are well-represented by a fully known linear Gaussian state space (SS) model, the celebrated Kalman filter (KF) is a low complexity optimal solution. However, both linearity of the underlying SS model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in practice. Here, we present KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator that learns from data to carry out Kalman filtering under non-linear dynamics with partial information. By incorporating the structural SS model with a dedicated recurrent neural network module in the flow of the KF, we retain data efficiency and interpretability of the classic algorithm while implicitly learning complex dynamics from data. We demonstrate numerically that KalmanNet overcomes non-linearities and model mismatch, outperforming classic filtering methods operating with both mismatched and accurate domain knowledge.}

ImageNet-21K dataset, which is bigger and more diverse, is used less frequently for pretraining, mainly due to its complexity, low accessibility, and underestimation of its added value. This paper aims to close this gap, and make high-quality efficient pretraining on ImageNet-21K available for everyone. Via a dedicated preprocessing stage, utilization of WordNet hierarchical structure, and a novel training scheme called semantic softmax, we show that various models significantly benefit from ImageNet-21K pretraining on numerous datasets and tasks, including small mobile-oriented models. We also show that we outperform previous ImageNet-21K pretraining schemes for prominent new models like ViT and Mixer. Our proposed pretraining pipeline is efficient, accessible, and leads to SoTA reproducible results, from a publicly available dataset.

  abstract = {It is known that the performance and life of fluidlubricated Harmonic Drive gears are dependent on a number of parameters. These include speed of rotation, output load, temperature, and type and amount of lubricant. In this paper we present and compare data on the performance and life of Harmonic Drive gears lubricated with PFPE and MAC fluid lubricants. These data include in-situ measurements of efficiency, torsional stiffness and, uniquely, axial force at the Flexspline/Wave-Generator interface made possible by a new test-rig. The latter measurement allows the friction at the WG/FS interface to be monitored which in turn provides an indication of the condition and effectiveness of the lubricant at this interface. The evolution of such parameters during the course of life tests has provided new insights into the behaviour of Harmonic Drive gears and, in particular, the fall-off in performance that defines useful life. 1. HARMONIC DRIVE GEARBOX Harmonic Drive gears are characterised by compactness, high reduction ratios, zero backlash and high positioning accuracy. Additionally they offer high power density (torque-to-weight ratio) and torsional stiffness and these, in particular, make them attractive for use in space applications [1, 2]. The first reported use of Harmonic Drive gears in space was in 1971 during the Apollo 15 mission (in actuators driving the lunar rover wheels) and since then they have found increasing use in space applications, most commonly in compact drive actuators for SADMs and APMs. In the present study testing was carried out on Harmonic Drive HFUC-20-160 component set fitted with hybridceramic Wave Generator bearings (silicon nitride balls, Cronidur{\textregistered} X30 steel races). The gearboxes were supplied fully lubricated and integrated within a testbox by Harmonic Drive AG, Limburg, Germany. Each gearbox comprises: a hybrid Wave Generator (WG) a thin-section radial bearing fitted onto an elliptical plug manufactured from 17-4PH, cond. H1150; a Circular Spline (CS) a rigid gear with internal teeth manufactured from 17-4PH steel, cond. H1150; and a Flexspline (FS) -- manufactured from 15-5PH, cond. H1075 and comprising a non-rigid, thin-walled cylindrical cup with external teeth on a slightly smaller diameter than the Circular Spline. The gear ratio is 160:1. The rated torque of the units is 40Nm. It is noted that the components parts of these gears are all sourced within Europe and that this is the first time this configuration has been subjected to thermal-vacuum testing.},

  abstract = {The current state-of-the-art in many natural language processing and automated knowledge base completion tasks is held by representation learning methods which learn distributed vector representations of symbols via gradient based optimization. They require little or no hand-crafted features, thus avoiding the need for most preprocessing steps and task-specific assumptions. However, in many cases representation learning requires a large amount of annotated training data to generalize well to unseen data. Such labeled training data is provided by human annotators who often use formal logic as the language for specifying annotations. This thesis investigates different combinations of representation learning methods with logic for reducing the need for annotated training data, and for improving generalization. We introduce a mapping of function-free first-order logic rules to loss functions that we combine with neural link prediction models. Using this method, logical prior knowledge is directly embedded in vector representations of predicates and constants. We find that this method learns accurate predicate representations for which no or little training data is available, while at the same time generalizing to other predicates not explicitly stated in rules. However, this method relies on grounding first-order logic rules, which does not scale to large rule sets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a scalable method for embedding implications in a vector space by only regularizing predicate representations. Subsequently, we explore a tighter integration of representation learning and logical deduction. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable prover -- a neural network that is recursively constructed from Prolog's backward chaining algorithm. The constructed network allows us to calculate the gradient of proofs with respect to symbol representations and to learn these representations from proving facts in a knowledge base. In addition to incorporating complex first-order rules, it induces interpretable logic programs via gradient descent. Lastly, we propose recurrent neural networks with conditional encoding and a neural attention mechanism for determining the logical relationship between two natural language sentences.},

Then, the multiple demonstrations are mapped to an upper-body humanoid robot through an inverse kinematics algorithm that attempts to track the kinematics of the movement of human arms.

Robots have relied heavily on human supervisors who are always available to provide additional observations to reduce uncertainty. We are instead interested in taking advantage of humans who are already in the environment to receive observations. The challenge is in modeling these humans' availability and higher costs of interruption to determine when to query them during navigation. In this work, we introduce a Human Observation Provider POMDP framework (HOP-POMDP), and contribute new algorithms for planning and executing with HOP-POMDPs that account for the differences between humans and other probabilistic sensors that provide observations. We compare optimal HOP-POMDP policies that plan for needing humans' observations with oracle POMDP policies that do not take human costs and availability into account. We show in benchmark tests and real-world environments that the oracle policies match the optimal HOP-POMDP policy 60\% of the time, and can be used in cases when humans are likely to be available on the shortest paths. However, the HOP-POMDP policies receive higher rewards in general as they take into account the possibility that a human may be unavailable. HOP-POMDP policies only need to be computed once prior to the deployment of the robot, so it is feasible to precompute and use in practice.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Surgical data science is a new research field that aims to observe all aspects of the patient treatment process in order to provide the right assistance at the right time. Due to the breakthrough successes of deep learning-based solutions for automatic image annotation, the availability of reference annotations for algorithm training is becoming a major bottleneck in the field. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the concept of self-supervised learning to address this issue. METHODS: Our approach is guided by the hypothesis that unlabeled video data can be used to learn a representation of the target domain that boosts the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms when used for pre-training. Core of the method is an auxiliary task based on raw endoscopic video data of the target domain that is used to initialize the convolutional neural network (CNN) for the target task. In this paper, we propose the re-colorization of medical images with a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based architecture as auxiliary task. A variant of the method involves a second pre-training step based on labeled data for the target task from a related domain. We validate both variants using medical instrument segmentation as target task. RESULTS: The proposed approach can be used to radically reduce the manual annotation effort involved in training CNNs. Compared to the baseline approach of generating annotated data from scratch, our method decreases exploratively the number of labeled images by up to 75\% without sacrificing performance. Our method also outperforms alternative methods for CNN pre-training, such as pre-training on publicly available non-medical (COCO) or medical data (MICCAI EndoVis2017 challenge) using the target task (in this instance: segmentation). CONCLUSION: As it makes efficient use of available (non-)public and (un-)labeled data, the approach has the potential to become a valuable tool for CNN (pre-)training.},

In this research chapter, we will discuss our skill-based platform SkiROS, that was developed on top of ROS in order to organize robot knowledge and its behavior. We will show how SkiROS offers the possibility to integrate different functionalities in form of skill `apps' and how SkiROS offers services for integrating these skill-apps into a consistent workspace. Furthermore, we will show how these skill-apps can be automatically executed based on autonomous, goal-directed task planning. SkiROS helps the developers to program and port their high-level code over a heterogeneous range of robots, meanwhile the minimal Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows non-expert users to start and supervise the execution. As an application example, we present how SkiROS was used to vertically integrate a robot into the manufacturing system of PSA Peugeot-Citro{\"e}n. We will discuss the characteristics of the SkiROS architecture which makes it not limited to the automotive industry but flexible enough to be used in other application areas as well. SkiROS has been developed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ROS indigo and it can be downloaded at https://github.com/frovida/skiros. A demonstration video is also available at https://youtu.be/mo7UbwXW5W0.},

The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review to first identify the most relevant authors in the domain of functional UI design principles. Focusing on the three most cited works of these authors, we extracted 257 principles. We next analyzed all these principles, unified their variants, and, considering their scientific influence, finally derived a shorter and core selection of 36 principles. This core selection provides educators and UI designers with a clear path to teach, evaluate, learn and improve the UI functional design.}

Its user-friendly Python-based API allows designing the most complex robot motions using a simple and intuitive syntax. At the same time, the modular structure of Horizon allows for easy customization on many levels, providing several recipes to handle fixed and floating-base systems, contact switching, variable time nodes, multiple transcriptions, integrators and solvers to guarantee flexibility towards diverse tasks. The proposed framework relies on direct simultaneous methods to transcribe the optimal problem into a nonlinear programming problem that can be solved by state-of-the-art solvers. In particular, it provides several off-the-shelf solvers, as well as two custom-implemented solvers, i.e. GN-SQP and Iterative Linear-Quadratic Regulator. Solutions of optimized problems can be stored for warm-starting, and re-sampled at a different frequency while enforcing dynamic feasibility. The proposed framework is validated through a number of use-case scenarios involving several robotic platforms. Finally, an in-depth analysis of a specific case study is carried out, where a highly dynamic motion (i.e., a twisting jump using the quadruped robot Spot{\textregistered} from BostonDynamics1) is generated, in order to highlight the main features of the framework and demonstrate its capabilities.}

  abstract = {Autonomous robotic surgery has the potential to provide efficacy, safety, and consistency independent of individual surgeon's skill and experience. Autonomous anastomosis is a challenging soft-tissue surgery task because it requires intricate imaging, tissue tracking, and surgical planning techniques, as well as a precise execution via highly adaptable control strategies often in unstructured and deformable environments. In the laparoscopic setting, such surgeries are even more challenging because of the need for high maneuverability and repeatability under motion and vision constraints. Here we describe an enhanced autonomous strategy for laparoscopic soft tissue surgery and demonstrate robotic laparoscopic small bowel anastomosis in phantom and in vivo intestinal tissues. This enhanced autonomous strategy allows the operator to select among autonomously generated surgical plans and the robot executes a wide range of tasks independently. We then use our enhanced autonomous strategy to perform in vivo autonomous robotic laparoscopic surgery for intestinal anastomosis on porcine models over a 1-week survival period. We compared the anastomosis quality criteria---including needle placement corrections, suture spacing, suture bite size, completion time, lumen patency, and leak pressure---of the developed autonomous system, manual laparoscopic surgery, and robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Data from a phantom model indicate that our system outperforms expert surgeons' manual technique and RAS technique in terms of consistency and accuracy. This was also replicated in the in vivo model. These results demonstrate that surgical robots exhibiting high levels of autonomy have the potential to improve consistency, patient outcomes, and access to a standard surgical technique.}

We extend the semantic of BTs to account for the uncertainty that affects both the conditions and action nodes of the BT. The tree gets synthesized following a planning strategy for BTs proposed recently: from a set of goal conditions we iteratively select a goal and find the action, or in general the subtree, that satisfies it. Such action may have preconditions that do not hold. For those preconditions, we find an action or subtree in the same fashion. We extend this approach by including, in the planner, actions that have the purpose to reduce the uncertainty that affects the value of a condition node in the BT (for example, turning on the lights to have better lighting conditions). We demonstrate that BBTs allows task planning with non-deterministic outcomes for actions. We provide experimental validation of our approach in a real robotic scenario and - for sake of reproducibility - in a simulated one.},

The objective of this paper is to perform a mini review on recent progress in the use of polymer-based additive manufacturing (AM) for O\&P devices and to gather insights from the O\&P professionals on the current practices and technologies and on the prospect of using AM techniques in this field. In our study, first, scientific articles on AM for O\&P devices were studied. Then, twenty-two (22) interviews were conducted with O\&P professionals from Canada. The primary focus was on five key areas: cost, material, design and fabrication efficiency, structural strength, functionality, and patient satisfaction. The cost of manufacturing the O\&P devices using AM techniques is lower as compared to the conventional methods. O\&P professionals expressed their concern over the materials and structural strength of the 3D-printed prosthetic devices. Published articles report comparable functionality and patient satisfaction for both O\&P devices. AM also greatly improves design and fabrication efficiency. However, due to a lack of qualification standards for 3D printed O\&P devices, 3D printing is being embraced more slowly in the O\&P business than in other industries.},

Traditional end-to-end evaluation methods are computationally expensive. Furthermore, evaluation of the retrieval model's performance based on query-document relevance labels shows a small correlation with the RAG system's downstream performance. We propose a novel evaluation approach, eRAG, where each document in the retrieval list is individually utilized by the large language model within the RAG system. The output generated for each document is then evaluated based on the downstream task ground truth labels. In this manner, the downstream performance for each document serves as its relevance label. We employ various downstream task metrics to obtain document-level annotations and aggregate them using set-based or ranking metrics. Extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets demonstrate that eRAG achieves a higher correlation with downstream RAG performance compared to baseline methods, with improvements in Kendall's tau correlation ranging from 0.168 to 0.494. Additionally, eRAG offers significant computational advantages, improving runtime and consuming up to 50 times less GPU memory than end-to-end evaluation.},

This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training.

  abstract = {We explore the use of Evolution Strategies (ES), a class of black box optimization algorithms, as an alternative to popular MDP-based RL techniques such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

These advancements caused the extension of the developments in manufacturing and information technology, and these coordinated and communicative technologies are constituted to the term, Industry 4.0 which was first announced from German government as one of the key initiatives and highlights a new industrial revolution. As a result, Industry 4.0 indicates more productive systems; companies have been searching the right adaptation of this term. On the other hand, the achievement criteria and performance measurements of the transformation to Industry 4.0 are still uncertain. Additionally, a structured and systematic implementation roadmap is still not clear. Thus, in this study, the fundamental relevance between design principles and technologies is given and conceptual framework for Industry 4.0 is proposed concerning fundamentals of smart products and smart processes development.},

In this paper we introduce FastDTW, an approximation of DTW that has a linear time and space complexity. FastDTW uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarser resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically. We also analyze the accuracy of FastDTW by comparing it to two other types of existing approximate DTW algorithms: constraints (such as Sakoe-Chiba Bands) and abstraction. Our results show a large improvement in accuracy over existing methods.}

In recent years, a variety of strategic initiatives around the world, including ``Industry 4.0'' introduced in Germany in 2011, have aimed to improve and connect manufacturing technologies in order to optimize production processes. In this work, the authors study the changing technological landscape of robotics and ``internet-of-things'' (IoT)-based connective technologies over the last 8-10 years in the wake of Industry 4.0. The authors interviewed key players within the European robotics ecosystem, including robotics manufacturers and integrators, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and applied industrial research institutions and synthesize our findings in this monograph. The author first detail the state-of-the-art robotics and IoT technologies they observed and that the companies discussed during our interviews. They then describe the processes the companies follow when deciding whether and how to integrate new technologies, the challenges they face when integrating these technologies, and some immediate future technological avenues they are exploring in robotics and IoT. Finally, based on their findings, the authors highlight key research directions for the robotics community that can enable improved capabilities in the context of manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Recently, the new Kinect One has been issued by Microsoft, providing the next generation of real-time range sensing devices based on the Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle. As the first Kinect version was using a structured light approach, one would expect various differences in the characteristics of the range data delivered by both devices. This paper presents a detailed and in-depth comparison between both devices. In order to conduct the comparison, we propose a framework of seven different experimental setups, which is a generic basis for evaluating range cameras such as Kinect. The experiments have been designed with the goal to capture individual effects of the Kinect devices as isolatedly as possible and in a way, that they can also be adopted, in order to apply them to any other range sensing device. The overall goal of this paper is to provide a solid insight into the pros and cons of either device. Thus, scientists that are interested in using Kinect range sensing cameras in their specific application scenario can directly assess the expected, specific benefits and potential problem of either device.}

  abstract = {Extensive work has been done on efficiently resolving hierarchical robot task specifications that minimize the \${\textbackslash}ell\$-2 norm of linear constraint violations, but not for \${\textbackslash}ell\$-1 norm, in which there has recently been growing interest for sparse control. Both approaches require solving a cascade of quadratic programs (QP) or linear programs (LP). In this letter, we introduce alternate and more efficient approaches to hierarchical \${\textbackslash}ell\$-1 norm minimization by formulating it as a single LP that can be solved by any off-the-shelf solver. The first approach is a recursive method that transforms the lexicographic LP (LLP) into a single objective problem using Lagrangian duality. The second approach, which forms the main focus of this letter, is a weighted method based on the exact penalty method, that is equivalent to the original LLP for a well chosen set of weights. We propose methods to compute and adapt these weights. The algorithms were applied on an interesting dual arm robot task. We discuss and benchmark the computational efficiency of these methods. Simplicity of the weighted method makes it a promising approach for tackling challenging prioritized robot control problems involving a control horizon or nonlinear constraints. Within this letter, we take the first step towards that goal by demonstrating the efficacy of the weighted method on a simpler instantaneous robot control problem with linear constraints.},

  abstract = {Biological systems, including human beings, have the innate ability to perform complex tasks in a versatile and agile manner. Researchers in sensorimotor control have aimed to comprehend and formally define this innate characteristic. The idea, supported by several experimental findings, that biological systems are able to combine and adapt basic units of motion into complex tasks finally leads to the formulation of the motor primitives' theory. In this respect, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) represent an elegant mathematical formulation of the motor primitives as stable dynamical systems and are well suited to generate motor commands for artificial systems like robots. In the last decades, DMPs have inspired researchers in different robotic fields including imitation and reinforcement learning, optimal control, physical interaction, and human--robot co-working, resulting in a considerable amount of published papers. The goal of this tutorial survey is two-fold. On one side, we present the existing DMP formulations in rigorous mathematical terms and discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach as well as practical implementation details. In the tutorial vein, we also search for existing implementations of presented approaches and release several others. On the other side, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of existing literature and categorize state-of-the-art work on DMP. The paper concludes with a discussion on the limitations of DMPs and an outline of possible research directions.},

In contrast to other approaches, the size and shape of the receptive field of each locally linear model, as well as the parameters of the locally linear model itself, are learned independently, that is, without the need for competition or any other kind of communication. Independent learning is accomplished by incrementally minimizing a weighted local cross-validation error. As a result, we obtain a learning system that can allocate resources as needed while dealing with the bias-variance dilemma in a principled way. The spatial localization of the linear models increases robustness toward negative interference. Our learning system can be interpreted as a nonparametric adaptive bandwidth smoother, as a mixture of experts where the experts are trained in isolation, and as a learning system that profits from combining independent expert knowledge on the same problem. This article illustrates the potential learning capabilities of purely local learning and offers an interesting and powerful approach to learning with receptive fields.},

  abstract = {Given the continuous stream of movements that biological systems exhibit in their daily activities, an account for such versatility and creativity has to assume that movement sequences consist of segments, executed either in sequence or with partial or complete overlap. Therefore, a fundamental question that has pervaded research in motor control both in artificial and biological systems revolves around identifying movement primitives (a.k.a. units of actions, basis behaviors, motor schemas, etc.). What are the fundamental building blocks that are strung together, adapted to, and created for ever new behaviors? This paper summarizes results that led to the hypothesis of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP). DMPs are units of action that are formalized as stable nonlinear attractor systems. They are useful for autonomous robotics as they are highly flexible in creating complex rhythmic (e.g., locomotion) and discrete (e.g., a tennis swing) behaviors that can quickly be adapted to the inevitable perturbations of a dynamically changing, stochastic environment. Moreover, DMPs provide a formal framework that also lends itself to investigations in computational neuroscience. A recent finding that allows creating DMPs with the help of well-understood statistical learning methods has elevated DMPs from a more heuristic to a principled modeling approach. Theoretical insights, evaluations on a humanoid robot, and behavioral and brain imaging data will serve to outline the framework of DMPs for a general approach to motor control in robotics and biology.},

Our method involves representing the search space of behavior trees as a formal grammar and searching over this grammar by means of a new generalization of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), named MCDAGS. Additionally, our method employs simulated annealing to expedite the aggregation of the most functional subtrees. We present simulated experiments for a marine target search and response scenario, and an abstract task selection problem. Our results demonstrate that the learned behavior trees compare favorably with a manually-designed tree, and outperform baseline learning methods. Overall, these results show that our method is a viable technique for the automatic design of behavior trees for robotic task planning.}

  abstract = {Acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be predicted by individual psychological correlates, examined here. Study 1 reports confirmatory validation of the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) following initial validation elsewhere. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the two-factor structure (Positive, Negative) and showed good convergent and divergent validity with a related scale. Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards AI. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards AI overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of AI. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards AI overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of AI. The dissociation between general trust and corporate distrust may reflect the public's attributions of the benefits and drawbacks of AI. Results are discussed in relation to theory and prior findings.}

  abstract = {Individual neurons in neural networks often represent a mixture of unrelated features. This phenomenon, called polysemanticity, can make interpreting neural networks more difficult and so we aim to understand its causes. We propose doing so through the lens of feature {\textbackslash}emph\{capacity\}, which is the fractional dimension each feature consumes in the embedding space. We show that in a toy model the optimal capacity allocation tends to monosemantically represent the most important features, polysemantically represent less important features (in proportion to their impact on the loss), and entirely ignore the least important features. Polysemanticity is more prevalent when the inputs have higher kurtosis or sparsity and more prevalent in some architectures than others. Given an optimal allocation of capacity, we go on to study the geometry of the embedding space. We find a block-semi-orthogonal structure, with differing block sizes in different models, highlighting the impact of model architecture on the interpretability of its neurons.},

Recently, approaches using search and learning have shown strong performance across a set of perfect information games, and approaches using game-theoretic reasoning and learning have shown strong performance for specific imperfect information poker variants. We introduce Player of Games, a general-purpose algorithm that unifies previous approaches, combining guided search, self-play learning, and game-theoretic reasoning. Player of Games is the first algorithm to achieve strong empirical performance in large perfect and imperfect information games -- an important step towards truly general algorithms for arbitrary environments. We prove that Player of Games is sound, converging to perfect play as available computation time and approximation capacity increases. Player of Games reaches strong performance in chess and Go, beats the strongest openly available agent in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker (Slumbot), and defeats the state-of-the-art agent in Scotland Yard, an imperfect information game that illustrates the value of guided search, learning, and game-theoretic reasoning.},

For managing ramp-up phases, real-time data infrastructure is central to support the learning and decision making process and thus to increase ramp-up agility. Along with this requirement, organizations are expected to have flatter hierarchical structures and be able to extend their product portfolio by implementing new technologies such as additive manufacturing.},

Reasoning about the motions of robots and objects simultaneously leads to a constrained planning problem in a high-dimensional state-space. Additionally, when environments change dynamically motions must be computed in real-time. To this end, we propose a feedback planner for manipulation. We model manipulation as constrained motion and use this model to automatically derive a set of constraint-based controllers. These controllers are used in a switching-control scheme, where the active controller is chosen by a reinforcement learning agent. Our approach is capable of addressing tasks with second-order dynamics, closed kinematic chains, and time-variant environments. We validated our approach in simulation and on a real, dual-arm robot. Extensive simulation of three distinct robots and tasks show a significant increase in robustness compared to a previous approach.},

A digital MaaS ecosystem can not only achieve scaling effects, but also realize new business models and overcome current and future challenges in the areas of legislation, sustainability, and standardization. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art of MaaS ecosystems and describes the development of a digital MaaS ecosystem based on an updated and advanced version of the reference architecture for smart connected factories, called the Smart Factory Web. Furthermore, this article describes a demonstrator for a federated MaaS marketplace for Catena-X which leverages the full technological potential of this digital ecosystem. In conclusion, the evaluation of the implemented digital ecosystem enables the advancement of the reference architecture Smart Factory Web, which can now be used as a blueprint for open, sustainable, and resilient digital manufacturing ecosystems.},

Estimating the gradient of this loss function, using samples, lies at the core of gradient-based learning algorithms for these problems. We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs---directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions---and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function's gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The generic scheme we propose unifies estimators derived in variety of prior work, along with variance-reduction techniques therein. It could assist researchers in developing intricate models involving a combination of stochastic and deterministic operations, enabling, for example, attention, memory, and control actions.},

We propose a modified expectation maximization algorithm to perform maximum a posteriori estimation to update the state estimate at each time step. Our modification makes it practical to perform the inference through calls to a physics simulation engine. This is significant because (i) it allows for the use of highly optimized physics simulation engines for the core computations of our tracking algorithm, and (ii) it makes it possible to naturally, and efficiently, account for physical constraints imposed by collisions, grasping actions, and material properties in the observation updates. Even in the presence of the relatively large occlusions that occur during manipulation tasks, our algorithm is able to robustly track a variety of types of deformable objects, including ones that are one-dimensional, such as ropes; two-dimensional, such as cloth; and three-dimensional, such as sponges. Our implementation can track these objects in real time.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have been transformative. They are pretrained foundational models that are self-supervised and can be adapted with fine-tuning to a wide range of natural language tasks, each of which previously would have required a separate network model. This is one step closer to the extraordinary versatility of human language. GPT-3 and, more recently, LaMDA, both of them LLMs, can carry on dialogs with humans on many topics after minimal priming with a few examples. However, there has been a wide range of reactions and debate on whether these LLMs understand what they are saying or exhibit signs of intelligence. This high variance is exhibited in three interviews with LLMs reaching wildly different conclusions. A new possibility was uncovered that could explain this divergence. What appears to be intelligence in LLMs may in fact be a mirror that reflects the intelligence of the interviewer, a remarkable twist that could be considered a reverse Turing test. If so, then by studying interviews, we may be learning more about the intelligence and beliefs of the interviewer than the intelligence of the LLMs. As LLMs become more capable, they may transform the way we interact with machines and how they interact with each other. Increasingly, LLMs are being coupled with sensorimotor devices. LLMs can talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? A road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined with seven major improvements inspired by brain systems and how LLMs could in turn be used to uncover new insights into brain function.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine GradCAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on weakly-supervised localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we conduct human studies to measure if GradCAM explanations help users establish trust in predictions from deep networks and show that GradCAM helps untrained users successfully discern a "stronger" deep network from a "weaker" one. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam. A demo and a video of the demo can be found at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org and youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

  abstract = {Remote teleoperation of robots can broaden the reach of domain specialists across a wide range of industries such as home maintenance, health care, light manufacturing, and construction. However, current direct control methods are impractical, and existing tools for programming robot remotely have focused on users with significant robotic experience. Extending robot remote programming to end users, i.e., users who are experts in a domain but novices in robotics, requires tools that balance the rich features necessary for complex teleoperation tasks with ease of use. The primary challenge to usability is that novice users are unable to specify complete and robust task plans to allow a robot to perform duties autonomously, particularly in highly variable environments. Our solution is to allow operators to specify shorter sequences of high-level commands, which we call task-level authoring, to create periods of variable robot autonomy. This approach allows inexperienced users to create robot behaviors in uncertain environments by interleaving exploration, specification of behaviors, and execution as separate steps. End users are able to break down the specification of tasks and adapt to the current needs of the interaction and environments, combining the reactivity of direct control to asynchronous operation. In this paper, we describe a prototype system contextualized in light manufacturing and its empirical validation in a user study where 18 participants with some programming experience were able to perform a variety of complex telemanipulation tasks with little training. Our results show that our approach allowed users to create flexible periods of autonomy and solve rich manipulation tasks. Furthermore, participants significantly preferred our system over comparative more direct interfaces, demonstrating the potential of our approach for enabling end users to effectively perform remote robot programming.}

  abstract = {This work discusses a novel human\&ndash;robot interface for a climbing robot for inspecting weld beads in storage tanks in the petrochemical industry. The approach aims to adapt robot autonomy in terms of the operator\&rsquo;s experience, where a remote industrial joystick works in conjunction with an electromyographic armband as inputs. This armband is worn on the forearm and can detect gestures from the operator and rotation angles from the arm. Information from the industrial joystick and the armband are used to control the robot via a Fuzzy controller. The controller works with sliding autonomy (using as inputs data from the angular velocity of the industrial controller, electromyography reading, weld bead position in the storage tank, and rotation angles executed by the operator\&rsquo;s arm) to generate a system capable of recognition of the operator\&rsquo;s skill and correction of mistakes from the operator in operating time. The output from the Fuzzy controller is the level of autonomy to be used by the robot. The levels implemented are Manual (operator controls the angular and linear velocities of the robot); Shared (speeds are shared between the operator and the autonomous system); Supervisory (robot controls the angular velocity to stay in the weld bead, and the operator controls the linear velocity); Autonomous (the operator defines endpoint and the robot controls both linear and angular velocities). These autonomy levels, along with the proposed sliding autonomy, are then analyzed through robot experiments in a simulated environment, showing each of these modes\&rsquo; purposes. The proposed approach is evaluated in virtual industrial scenarios through real distinct operators.},

  abstract = {The field of AI alignment is concerned with AI systems that pursue unintended goals. One commonly studied mechanism by which an unintended goal might arise is specification gaming, in which the designer-provided specification is flawed in a way that the designers did not foresee. However, an AI system may pursue an undesired goal even when the specification is correct, in the case of goal misgeneralization. Goal misgeneralization is a specific form of robustness failure for learning algorithms in which the learned program competently pursues an undesired goal that leads to good performance in training situations but bad performance in novel test situations. We demonstrate that goal misgeneralization can occur in practical systems by providing several examples in deep learning systems across a variety of domains. Extrapolating forward to more capable systems, we provide hypotheticals that illustrate how goal misgeneralization could lead to catastrophic risk. We suggest several research directions that could reduce the risk of goal misgeneralization for future systems.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of learning differentiable functions expressed as programs in a domain-specific language. Such programmatic models can offer benefits such as composability and interpretability; however, learning them requires optimizing over a combinatorial space of program "architectures". We frame this optimization problem as a search in a weighted graph whose paths encode top-down derivations of program syntax. Our key innovation is to view various classes of neural networks as continuous relaxations over the space of programs, which can then be used to complete any partial program. This relaxed program is differentiable and can be trained end-to-end, and the resulting training loss is an approximately admissible heuristic that can guide the combinatorial search. We instantiate our approach on top of the A* algorithm and an iteratively deepened branch-and-bound search, and use these algorithms to learn programmatic classifiers in three sequence classification tasks. Our experiments show that the algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods for program learning, and that they discover programmatic classifiers that yield natural interpretations and achieve competitive accuracy.},

  abstract = {Goal-conditioned policies for robotic navigation can be trained on large, unannotated datasets, providing for good generalization to real-world settings. However, particularly in vision-based settings where specifying goals requires an image, this makes for an unnatural interface. Language provides a more convenient modality for communication with robots, but contemporary methods typically require expensive supervision, in the form of trajectories annotated with language descriptions. We present a system, LM-Nav, for robotic navigation that enjoys the benefits of training on unannotated large datasets of trajectories, while still providing a high-level interface to the user. Instead of utilizing a labeled instruction following dataset, we show that such a system can be constructed entirely out of pre-trained models for navigation (ViNG), image-language association (CLIP), and language modeling (GPT-3), without requiring any fine-tuning or language-annotated robot data. LM-Nav extracts landmarks names from an instruction, grounds them in the world via the image-language model, and then reaches them via the (vision-only) navigation model. We instantiate LM-Nav on a real-world  mobile robot and demonstrate long-horizon navigation through complex, outdoor environments from natural language instructions.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning can train policies that effectively perform complex tasks. However for long-horizon tasks, the performance of these methods degrades with horizon, often necessitating reasoning over and chaining lower-level skills. Hierarchical reinforcement learning aims to enable this by providing a bank of low-level skills as action abstractions. Hierarchies can further improve on this by abstracting the space states as well. We posit that a suitable state abstraction should depend on the capabilities of the available lower-level policies. We propose Value Function Spaces: a simple approach that produces such a representation by using the value functions corresponding to each lower-level skill. These value functions capture the affordances of the scene, thus forming a representation that compactly abstracts task relevant information and robustly ignores distractors. Empirical evaluations for maze-solving and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach improves long-horizon performance and enables better zero-shot generalization than alternative model-free and model-based methods.},

While RL offers a framework for building self-improving robots that can learn via trial-and-error autonomously, practical realizations end up requiring extensive human supervision for reward function design and repeated resetting of the environment between episodes of interactions. In this work, we propose MEDAL++, a novel design for self-improving robotic systems: given a small set of expert demonstrations at the start, the robot autonomously practices the task by learning to both do and undo the task, simultaneously inferring the reward function from the demonstrations. The policy and reward function are learned end-to-end from high-dimensional visual inputs, bypassing the need for explicit state estimation or task-specific pre-training for visual encoders used in prior work. We first evaluate our proposed system on a simulated non-episodic benchmark EARL, finding that MEDAL++ is both more data efficient and gets up to 30\% better final performance compared to state-of-the-art vision-based methods. Our real-robot experiments show that MEDAL++ can be applied to manipulation problems in larger environments than those considered in prior work, and autonomous self-improvement can improve the success rate by 30\% to 70\% over behavioral cloning on just the expert data.},

Trends were characterized in the use of robotic surgery for common procedures for which traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery was already considered a safe and effective approach for most surgeons when clinically feasible. A multigroup interrupted time series analysis was performed to determine how procedural approaches (open, laparoscopic, and robotic) change after hospitals launch a robotic surgery program. Data were analyzed from March 1 through April 19, 2019.Initiation of robotic surgery.Procedure approach (ie, robotic, open, or laparoscopic).The study cohort included 169\,404 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [16.9] years; 90\,595 women [53.5\%]) at 73 hospitals. The use of robotic surgery increased from 1.8\% in 2012 to 15.1\% in 2018 (8.4-fold increase; slope, 2.1\% per year; 95\% CI, 1.9\%-2.3\%). For certain procedures, the magnitude of the increase was greater; for example, for inguinal hernia repair, the use of robotic surgery increased from 0.7\% to 28.8\% (41.1-fold change; slope, 5.4\% per year; 95\% CI, 5.1\%-5.7\%). The use of robotic surgery increased 8.8\% in the first 4 years after hospitals began performing robotic surgery (2.8\% per year; 95\% CI, 2.7\%-2.9\%). This trend was associated with a decrease in laparoscopic surgery from 53.2\% to 51.3\% (difference, -1.9\%; 95\% CI, -2.2\% to -1.6\%). Before adopting robotic surgery, hospitals' use of laparoscopic surgery increased 1.3\% per year. After adopting robotic surgery, the use of laparoscopic surgery declined 0.3\% (difference in trends, -1.6\%; 95\% CI, -1.7\% to -1.5\%).These results suggest that robotic surgery has continued to diffuse across a broad range of common surgical procedures. Hospitals that launched robotic surgery programs had a broad and immediate increase in the use of robotic surgery, which was associated with a decrease in traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.},

As in other fields of AI, deep learning-based end-to-end approaches have made great advances in program synthesis. However, compared to other fields such as computer vision, program synthesis provides greater opportunities to explicitly exploit structured information such as execution traces. While execution traces can provide highly detailed guidance for a program synthesis method, they are more difficult to obtain than more basic forms of specification such as input/output pairs. Therefore, we use the insight that we can split the process into two parts: infer traces from input/output examples, then infer programs from traces.

Planar rotations combine by summing their angles modulo 2{$\pi$} ; so one way to generate a uniform planar rotation is to generate a uniform angle. This chapter describes a uniformly distributed spatial rotation as one not having a uniformly distributed angle. For a unit quaternion, the {$\omega$} component is the cosine of half the angle of rotation. When the angle is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2{$\pi$}, the average magnitude of {$\omega$} will be 2/{$\pi$} 0.6366, which exceeds the correct value for a uniform rotation by a factor of 3/2. It is easy to generate random unit quaternions and, hence, rotations with the correct distribution. Pairs of independent variables with Gaussian distribution can easily be generated using the polar or Box--Muller method, which transforms a point uniformly distributed within the unit disk. The Gaussian generation can be folded into the unit quaternion generation to give an efficient algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a deep neural networks (DNN) based PBE model called Neural Programming by Example (NPBE), which can learn from input-output strings and induce programs that solve the string manipulation problems. Our NPBE model has four neural network based components: a string encoder, an input-output analyzer, a program generator, and a symbol selector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NPBE by training it end-to-end to solve some common string manipulation problems in spreadsheet systems. The results show that our model can induce string manipulation programs effectively. Our work is one step towards teaching DNN to generate computer programs.},

  abstract = {Modern deep learning systems are increasingly deployed in situations such as personalization and federated learning where it is necessary to support i) learning on small amounts of data, and ii) communication efficient distributed training protocols. In this work, we develop FiLM Transfer (FiT) which fulfills these requirements in the image classification setting by combining ideas from transfer learning (fixed pretrained backbones and fine-tuned FiLM adapter layers) and meta-learning (automatically configured Naive Bayes classifiers and episodic training) to yield parameter efficient models with superior classification accuracy at low-shot. The resulting parameter efficiency is key for enabling few-shot learning, inexpensive model updates for personalization, and communication efficient federated learning. We experiment with FiT on a wide range of downstream datasets and show that it achieves better classification accuracy than the leading Big Transfer (BiT) algorithm at low-shot and achieves state-of-the art accuracy on the challenging VTAB-1k benchmark, with fewer than 1\% of the updateable parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the parameter efficiency and superior accuracy of FiT in distributed low-shot applications including model personalization and federated learning where model update size is an important performance metric.},

Each processor updates its state by applying a "sigmoidal" function to a linear combination of the previous states of all units. We prove that one may simulate all Turing machines by such nets. In particular, one can simulate any multi-stack Turing machine in real time, and there is a net made up of 886 processors which computes a universal partial-recursive function. Products (high order nets) are not required, contrary to what had been stated in the literature. Non-deterministic Turing machines can be simulated by non-deterministic rational nets, also in real time. The simulation result has many consequences regarding the decidability, or more generally the complexity, of questions about recursive nets.}

This is in contrast to the view that specialised problem formulations are needed for each ability, based on other signals or objectives. Furthermore, we suggest that agents that learn through trial and error experience to maximise reward could learn behaviour that exhibits most if not all of these abilities, and therefore that powerful reinforcement learning agents could constitute a solution to artificial general intelligence.},

Alternative control strategies which have first been optimized with the same cost function are then assessed in terms of their optimized behavior. It is demonstrated that the optimal control strategy for a particular task is a function not only of task geometry, but also of the desired performance.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The combination of deep neural network models and reinforcement learning algorithms can make it possible to learn policies for robotic behaviors that directly read in raw sensory inputs, such as camera images, effectively subsuming both estimation and control into one model. However, real-world applications of reinforcement learning must specify the goal of the task by means of a manually programmed reward function, which in practice requires either designing the very same perception pipeline that end-to-end reinforcement learning promises to avoid, or else instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to determine if the task has been performed successfully. In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for manual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from a modest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively solicited queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label to determine whether that state represents successful completion of the task. While requesting labels for every single state would amount to asking the user to manually provide the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a tiny fraction of the states seen during training, making it an efficient and practical approach for learning skills without manually engineered rewards. We evaluate our method on real-world robotic manipulation tasks where the observations consist of images viewed by the robot's camera. In our experiments, our method effectively learns to arrange objects, place books, and drape cloth, directly from images and without any manually specified reward functions, and with only 1-4 hours of interaction with the real world.},

To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

Existing top-down approaches tackle this problem by either combining independent task-specific networks or translating methods from the image domain ignoring the intricacies of LiDAR data and thus often resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we present the novel top-down Efficient LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (EfficientLPS) architecture that addresses multiple challenges in segmenting LiDAR point clouds including distance-dependent sparsity, severe occlusions, large scale-variations, and re-projection errors. EfficientLPS comprises of a novel shared backbone that encodes with strengthened geometric transformation modeling capacity and aggregates semantically rich range-aware multi-scale features. It incorporates new scale-invariant semantic and instance segmentation heads along with the panoptic fusion module which is supervised by our proposed panoptic periphery loss function. Additionally, we formulate a regularized pseudo labeling framework to further improve the performance of EfficientLPS by training on unlabelled data. We benchmark our proposed model on two large-scale LiDAR datasets: nuScenes, for which we also provide ground truth annotations, and SemanticKITTI. Notably, EfficientLPS sets the new state-of-the-art on both these datasets.},

We say that a proxy is \textbf{unhackable} if increasing the expected proxy return can never decrease the expected true return. Intuitively, it might be possible to create an unhackable proxy by leaving some terms out of the reward function (making it "narrower") or overlooking fine-grained distinctions between roughly equivalent outcomes, but we show this is usually not the case. A key insight is that the linearity of reward (in state-action visit counts) makes unhackability a very strong condition. In particular, for the set of all stochastic policies, two reward functions can only be unhackable if one of them is constant. We thus turn our attention to deterministic policies and finite sets of stochastic policies, where non-trivial unhackable pairs always exist, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of simplifications, an important special case of unhackability. Our results reveal a tension between using reward functions to specify narrow tasks and aligning AI systems with human values.},

De Schutter (2007) is a systematic constraint-based approach to specify complex tasks of general sensor-based robot systems. iTASC integrates both instantaneous task specification and estimation of geometric uncertainty in a unified framework. Automatic derivation of controller and estimator equations follows from a geometric task model that is obtained using a systematic task modeling procedure. The approach applies to a large variety of robot systems (mobile robots, multiple robot systems, dynamic human-robot interaction, etc.), various sensor systems, and different robot tasks. Using an example task, this paper shows that iTASC is a powerful tool for multi-sensor integration in robot manipulation. The example task includes multiple sensors: encoders, a force sensor, cameras, a laser distance sensor and a laser scanner. The paper details the systematic modeling procedure for the example task and elaborates on the task specific choice of two types of task coordinates: feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which facilitate the task specification, and uncertainty coordinates to model geometric uncertainty.

  abstract = {A set of hypotheses is formulated for a connectionist approach to cognitive modeling. These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic models.Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide an understanding of cognition.},

Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning.

With program synthesis techniques not only software developers could be supported in their everyday work but even users without any programming knowledge could be empowered to automate repetitive tasks and implement their own new functionality. In recent years, many novel program synthesis approaches based on evolutionary algorithms have been proposed and evaluated on common benchmark problems. Therefore, we identify and discuss in this survey the relevant evolutionary program synthesis approaches in the literature and provide an in-depth analysis of their performance. The most influential approaches we identify are stack-based, grammar-guided, as well as linear genetic programming (GP). For the stack-based approaches, we identify 37 in-scope papers, and for the grammar-guided and linear GP approaches, we identify 12 and 5 papers, respectively. Furthermore, we find that these approaches perform well on benchmark problems if there is a simple mapping from the given input to the correct output. On problems where this mapping is complex, e.g., if the problem consists of several subproblems or requires iteration/recursion for a correct solution, results tend to be worse. Consequently, for future work, we encourage researchers not only to use a program's output for assessing the quality of a solution but also the way toward a solution (e.g., correctly solved subproblems).},

We assessed the utility of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) using data collected from a survey sample of 378 respondents, modeling user acceptance in terms of behavioral intention to use AI-based intelligent products. In addition, we employed decomposition analysis to compare each factor included in these models in terms of influence on purchase intention. We found that the VAM performed best in modeling user acceptance. Among the various factors, enjoyment was found to influence user purchase intention the most, followed by subjective norms. The findings of this study confirm that acceptance of highly innovative products with minimal practical value, such as AI-based intelligent products, is more influenced by interest in technology than in utilitarian aspects.},

Our method significantly improves adaptation to changes in dynamics in high noise settings, which are common in robotics applications. We validate our approach on a quadruped robot that learns to walk while subject to changes in dynamics. We observe that our method significantly outperforms prior gradient-based approaches, enabling the robot to adapt its policy to changes based on less than 3 minutes of real data.},

Many embodied cognition theorists object to the central role that representations play on the traditional view of cognition. Based on these objections, it may seem that the lesson from embodied cognition is that AI should abandon representation as a central component of intelligence. However, I argue that the lesson from embodied cognition is actually that AI research should shift its focus from how to utilize explicit representations to how to create and use tacit representations. To develop this suggestion, I provide an overview of the commitments of the classical view and distinguish three critiques of the role that representations play in that view. I provide further exploration and defense of Daniel Dennett's distinction between explicit and tacit representations. I argue that we should understand the embodied cognition approach using a framework that includes tacit representations. Given this perspective, I will explore some AI research areas that may be recommended by an embodied perspective on cognition.},

We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

To this end, we introduce universal planning networks (UPN). UPNs embed differentiable planning within a goal-directed policy. This planning computation unrolls a forward model in a latent space and infers an optimal action plan through gradient descent trajectory optimization. The plan-by-gradient-descent process and its underlying representations are learned end-to-end to directly optimize a supervised imitation learning objective. We find that the representations learned are not only effective for goal-directed visual imitation via gradient-based trajectory optimization, but can also provide a metric for specifying goals using images. The learned representations can be leveraged to specify distance-based rewards to reach new target states for model-free reinforcement learning, resulting in substantially more effective learning when solving new tasks described via image based goals. We were able to achieve successful transfer of visuomotor planning strategies across robots with significantly different morphologies and actuation capabilities.

This paper reveals the rate of ageing of a national fleet of wind turbines using free public data for the actual and theoretical ideal load factors from the UK's 282 wind farms. Actual load factors are recorded monthly for the period of 2002--2012, covering 1686 farm-years of operation. Ideal load factors are derived from a high resolution wind resource assessment made using NASA data to estimate the hourly wind speed at the location and hub height of each wind farm, accounting for the particular models of turbine installed. By accounting for individual site conditions we confirm that load factors do decline with age, at a similar rate to other rotating machinery. Wind turbines are found to lose 1.6~{\textpm}~0.2\% of their output per year, with average load factors declining from 28.5\% when new to 21\% at age 19. This trend is consistent for different generations of turbine design and individual wind farms. This level of degradation reduces a wind farm's output by 12\% over a twenty year lifetime, increasing the levelised cost of electricity by 9\%.},

The design goal of HoLLiE was to be human-like but abstract enough to ensure a high level of acceptance, which is very advantageous for its use in hospitals. After a short retrospect of previous generations of HoLLiE, it is highlighted how the current version is equipped with a variety of additional sensors and actuators to allow a wide range of possible applications. Then, the software stack of HoLLiE is depicted, with a focus on navigation and force-sensitive intention recognition.},

But such automation is expensive, also because test experts are required to program the robots. One approach to lowering these costs is to enable shop-floor workers to program robots by providing task-level programming tools. Task-level programming is an established approach, yet appropriate workflows for experts and shop-floor workers remain to be defined. The objective of this letter is to evaluate RAZER, a framework for robot task-level programming, in which skill programming and parameter interface definitions are integrated. The framework provides workflows for both experts-creating skills and providing their parameter interfaces-and for shop-floor workers-using these skills to create executable robot tasks in an intuitive human-robot interface (HRI). The HRI is a graphical user interface that runs in a browser, and provides access to other man-machine interface, such as programming by demonstration.

  abstract = {For robots to follow instructions from people, they must be able to connect the rich semantic information in human vocabulary, e.g. ``can you get me the pink stuffed whale?'' to their sensory observations and actions. This brings up a notably difficult challenge for robots: while robot learning approaches allow robots to learn many different behaviors from first-hand experience, it is impractical for robots to have first-hand experiences that span all of this semantic information. We would like a robot's policy to be able to perceive and pick up the pink stuffed whale, even if it has never seen any data interacting with a stuffed whale before. Fortunately, static data on the internet has vast semantic information, and this information is captured in pre-trained vision-language models. In this paper, we study whether we can interface robot policies with these pre-trained models, with the aim of allowing robots to complete instructions involving object categories that the robot has never seen first-hand. We develop a simple approach, which we call Manipulation of Open-World Objects (MOO), which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model to extract object-identifying information from the language command and image, and conditions the robot policy on the current image, the instruction, and the extracted object information. In a variety of experiments on a real mobile manipulator, we find that MOO generalizes zero-shot to a wide range of novel object categories and environments. In addition, we show how MOO generalizes to other, non-language-based input modalities to specify the object of interest such as finger pointing, and how it can be further extended to enable open-world navigation and manipulation.

Surgical resection with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy currently provides the only chance of long-term survival. However, only 10--20\% of patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed with localized, surgically resectable disease. The majority of patients present with metastatic disease and are not candidates for surgery, while surgery remains underused even in those with resectable disease owing to historical concerns regarding safety and efficacy. However, advances made over the past decade in the safety and efficacy of surgery have resulted in perioperative mortality of around 3\% and 5-year survival approaching 30\% after resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, owing to advances in both surgical techniques and systemic chemotherapy, the indications for resection have been extended to include locally advanced tumours. Many aspects of pancreatic cancer surgery, such as the management of postoperative morbidities, sequencing of resection and systemic therapy, and use of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection for tumours previously considered unresectable, are rapidly evolving. In this Review, we summarize the current status of and new developments in pancreatic cancer surgery, while highlighting the most important research questions for attempts to further optimize outcomes.},

We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach by applying our algorithm PI2 to sequences of Dynamic Movement Primitives. For robots, this representation has some important advantages over discrete representations in terms of scalability and convergence speed. The parameters of the Dynamic Movement Primitives are learned simultaneously at different levels of temporal abstraction. The shape of a movement primitive is optimized w.r.t. the costs up to the next primitive in the sequence, and the subgoals between two movement primitives w.r.t. the costs up to the end of the entire movement primitive sequence. We implement our approach on an 11-DOF arm and hand, and evaluate it in a pick-and-place task in which the robot transports an object between different shelves in a cupboard.},

In this article, a five-degree-of-freedom robot with non-backlash driving is presented. A parallelogram structure with diagonal driven is used for robotic arms which is useful to improve the overall stiffness of the robot. First, the detailed structure of the robot is introduced, and the kinematic characteristics of the robot are analyzed. Second, a stiffness approximation method is proposed to evaluate the stiffness of the robot in the global workspace. The overall deformations under certain external loads which are composed of deflection deformations and stretching deformations are calculated based on the strain energy method and the properties of the components. The effectiveness of the approximation method used for evaluating the stiffness of the robot which has hybrid open- and closed-loop kinematic chains is verified through the finite element analysis results and the experimental results. Finally, the stiffness evaluation results show that the stiffness of the proposed robot is better than that of the industrial robot, which makes it more suitable for most of the industrial applications, such as handling, palletizing, and drilling.},

  abstract = {Grasping unseen objects in unconstrained, cluttered environments is an essential skill for autonomous robotic manipulation. Despite recent progress in full 6-DoF grasp learning, existing approaches often consist of complex sequential pipelines that possess several potential failure points and run-times unsuitable for closed-loop grasping. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end network that efficiently generates a distribution of 6-DoF parallel-jaw grasps directly from a depth recording of a scene. Our novel grasp representation treats 3D points of the recorded point cloud as potential grasp contacts. By rooting the full 6-DoF grasp pose and width in the observed point cloud, we can reduce the dimensionality of our grasp representation to 4-DoF which greatly facilitates the learning process. Our class-agnostic approach is trained on 17 million simulated grasps and generalizes well to real world sensor data. In a robotic grasping study of unseen objects in structured clutter we achieve over 90\% success rate, cutting the failure rate in half compared to a recent state-of-the-art method.},

Human actions can be represented using various data modalities, such as RGB, skeleton, depth, infrared, point cloud, event stream, audio, acceleration, radar, and WiFi signal, which encode different sources of useful yet distinct information and have various advantages depending on the application scenarios. Consequently, lots of existing works have attempted to investigate different types of approaches for HAR using various modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent progress in deep learning methods for HAR based on the type of input data modality. Specifically, we review the current mainstream deep learning methods for single data modalities and multiple data modalities, including the fusion-based and the co-learning-based frameworks. We also present comparative results on several benchmark datasets for HAR, together with insightful observations and inspiring future research directions.},

The dynamic system state is a low-dimensional representation of the boundary, and the boundary estimation involves incorporating curve evolution into recursive state estimation. By formulating the problem as one of state estimation, the segmentation at each particular time is based not only on the data observed at that instant, but also on predictions based on past and future boundary estimates. Although this paper focuses on left ventricle segmentation, the method generalizes to temporally segmenting any deformable object.},

The way we accomplish alignment is by learning to perform auxiliary self-supervised task(s) on both domains simultaneously. Each self-supervised task brings the two domains closer together along the direction relevant to that task. Training this jointly with the main task classifier on the source domain is shown to successfully generalize to the unlabeled target domain. The presented objective is straightforward to implement and easy to optimize. We achieve state-of-the-art results on four out of seven standard benchmarks, and competitive results on segmentation adaptation.

Neuro-symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning. They have also been shown to obtain high accuracy with significantly less training data than traditional models. Due to the recency of the field's emergence and relative sparsity of published results, the performance characteristics of these models are not well understood. In this paper, we describe and analyze the performance characteristics of three recent neuro-symbolic models. We find that symbolic models have less potential parallelism than traditional neural models due to complex control flow and low-operational-intensity operations, such as scalar multiplication and tensor addition. However, the neural aspect of computation dominates the symbolic part in cases where they are clearly separable. We also find that data movement poses a potential bottleneck, as it does in many ML workloads.},

  abstract = {I have stolen my title from the title of a paper given by Marvin Minsky in the 1960s, because it most effectively expresses what I will try to convey in this talk.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. Programming provides us with new tools to express ourselves. We now have intellectual tools to describe "how to" as well as "what is." This is a profound transformation: it is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think.For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of some subject but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior on particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express. But now we can express it!Expressing methodology in a computer language forces it to be unambiguous and computationally effective. The task of formulating a method as a computer-executable program and debugging that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process. The programmer expresses his/her poorly understood or sloppily formulated idea in a precise way, so that it becomes clear what is poorly understood or sloppily formulated. Also, once formalized procedurally, a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results.I will defend this viewpoint with examples and demonstrations from electrical engineering and from classical mechanics.},

The computed dynamics can then be used for torque control with inverse dynamics, or for forward dynamics computations. RNEA can be framed as a differentiable computational graph, enabling the dynamics parameters of the robot to be learned from data. However, the dynamics parameters learned in this manner can be physically implausible. In this work, we incorporate physical constraints in the learning by adding structure to the learned parameters. This results in a framework that can learn physically plausible dynamics, improving the training speed as well as generalization of the learned dynamics models. We evaluate our method on real-time inverse dynamics predictions of a 7 degree of freedom robot arm, both in simulation and on the real robot.

  abstract = {Learning, planning, and representing knowledge at multiple levels of temporal abstraction are key, longstanding challenges for AI. In this paper we consider how these challenges can be addressed within the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes (MDPs). We extend the usual notion of action in this framework to include options---closed-loop policies for taking action over a period of time. Examples of options include picking up an object, going to lunch, and traveling to a distant city, as well as primitive actions such as muscle twitches and joint torques. Overall, we show that options enable temporally abstract knowledge and action to be included in the reinforcement learning framework in a natural and general way. In particular, we show that options may be used interchangeably with primitive actions in planning methods such as dynamic programming and in learning methods such as Q-learning. Formally, a set of options defined over an MDP constitutes a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and the theory of SMDPs provides the foundation for the theory of options. However, the most interesting issues concern the interplay between the underlying MDP and the SMDP and are thus beyond SMDP theory. We present results for three such cases: (1) we show that the results of planning with options can be used during execution to interrupt options and thereby perform even better than planned, (2) we introduce new intra-option methods that are able to learn about an option from fragments of its execution, and (3) we propose a notion of subgoal that can be used to improve the options themselves. All of these results have precursors in the existing literature; the contribution of this paper is to establish them in a simpler and more general setting with fewer changes to the existing reinforcement learning framework. In particular, we show that these results can be obtained without committing to (or ruling out) any particular approach to state abstraction, hierarchy, function approximation, or the macro-utility problem.},

Current decision support systems (DSS) are still overly simple and static, and cannot adapt to changing environments we expect to deploy in modern systems [3], [4], [9], [11]. They are intrinsically limited in their ability to explain rationale versus merely listing their future behaviors, limiting a human's understanding of the system [2], [7]. Most probabilistic assessments of a task are conveyed after the task/skill is attempted rather than before [10], [14], [16]. This limits failure recovery and danger avoidance mechanisms. Existing work on predicting failures relies on sensors to accurately detect explicitly annotated and learned failure modes [13]. As such, important non-obvious pieces of information for assessing appropriate trust and/or course-of-action (COA) evaluation in collaborative scenarios can go overlooked, while irrelevant information may instead be provided that increases clutter and mental workload. Understanding how AI models arrive at specific decisions is a key principle of trust [8]. Therefore, it is critically important to develop new strategies for anticipating, communicating, and explaining justifications and rationale for AI driven behaviors via contextually appropriate semantics.},

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4\% top-1 / 97.1\% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7\%), Flower (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.},

To address this problem, the use of healthcare robot is increasingly being recognized to have strong potential in addressing older adult and psychiatric patients' healthcare and welfare needs. The purpose of this preliminary study is to evaluate the changes in the autonomic nervous activity of an elderly patient with schizophrenia during upper limb range of motion (ROM) exercises led by Pepper (SoftBank Robotics) with the application program of Care Prevention Gymnastics Exercises (Pepper-CPGE) made by Xing Company in Japan. A Pepper-CPGE-led three-minute radio gymnastics program (Radio Exercises \#1, consisted of three types of exercises) and instructions were developed. The normal aging 69-year old schizophrenic subject followed instructions from Pepper throughout the intervention. Electrocardiography (ECG) records, heart rate, acceleration score, and ROM exercises of upper limb were collected and analyzed using the GSM's Bonaly Light instrument and Image-J analysis. (1) The high-frequency (HF) (indicative of parasympathetic nervous activity), and low-frequency (LF)/HF ratio (indicative of sympathetic nerve activity) were increased in reference from the baseline data before the exercise stretching the chest. (2) The momentum decreased as the ROM of shoulder joint flexion declined. Declines in both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous activity were observed. Also, (3) when the exercise "bend the body forward" was performed, the HF and LF/HF also decreased. Evaluation of robot-based rehabilitation exercise program effectiveness by the ROM exercises image analysis and autonomic nervous activity is essential for the futurist programming of ROM exercise among patients with schizophrenia.},

Today, technological companies are developing robots that meet universal health care technology demands. While human caring focus on human-to-human relationships,but between humans and nonhumans, e.g. Humanoid Nursing Robot (HNRs)-to-human relationships, caring practices have not been forthcoming. When HNRs can support patients independently, capabilities much like being human will be required, including intelligence and skill competencies. Currently, Tanioka's research group is conducting clinical trials of humanoid robots equipped with applications using Pepper (manufactured by SOFTBANK CORPORATION), towards elderly care and rehabilitation at the Mifune Hospital, Kagawa prefecture. Care Prevention Gymnastics Exercises (Pepper-CPGE) was madeby Xing Company, Japan. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the clinical trial outcomes based on the Transactive Relationship Theory of Nursing (TRETON) (Tanioka, 2017) emphasizing nursing engagement processes between HNRs and human persons. Observable effects include positive changes in relationships of patients, humanoid robots and healthcare providers. Emphasizing ethical concerns and human person safety as critical factors of care, and fears for divergent robot use are observed.

Nevertheless, Japan has taken measures to compensate for these shortages by promoting medical and nursing care activities using robotic technologies, and employing human resources from overseas. The purpose of this study was to determine potential legal issues and subsequent implications for care during prevention gymnastic exercises for the elderly using Pepper in long-term health facilities. The application program of Care-Prevention Gymnastics Exercises for Pepper (Pepper with CPGE) was made by the Xing Company Japan. Currently, care workers become intermediaries for the safe use of Pepper with CPGE. However, it was realized that some legal issues may arise if Pepper with CPGE alone will carry out these preventive care programs for the elderly without the presence of care workers as intermediaries. In this situation, using Pepper with CPGE alone to conduct care prevention gymnastics will require safety measures to prevent these possible practice issues and anticipate implications for care. In this regard, determining detailed target levels of rehabilitation exercise demands and environmental setting safety become essential factors. The use of humanoid robots in healthcare is expected to influence more practice protocols in contemporary and futurist rehabilitative human care. The identification of possible safety issues in performance and environmental situations, and implications for care are critical to ensure safe and valuable rehabilitative health care practices for the elderly population.},

In some domains, like bioinformatics and robotics, it is very difficult to construct a large-scale well-annotated dataset due to the expense of data acquisition and costly annotation, which limits its development. Transfer learning relaxes the hypothesis that the training data must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with the test data, which motivates us to use transfer learning to solve the problem of insufficient training data. This survey focuses on reviewing the current researches of transfer learning by using deep neural network and its applications. We defined deep transfer learning, category and review the recent research works based on the techniques used in deep transfer learning.},

A solution to this symbol grounding problem (Harnad, 1990) would enable a robot to interpret commands such as ``Drive over to receiving and pick up the tire pallet.'' In this article we describe several of our results that use probabilistic inference to address the symbol grounding problem. Our specific approach is to develop models that factor according to the linguistic structure of a command. We first describe an early result, a generative model that factors according to the sequential structure of language, and then discuss our new framework, generalized grounding graphs (G3). The G3 framework dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a natural language input, enabling a mapping between words in language and concrete objects, places, paths and events in the external world. We report on corpus-based experiments where the robot is able to learn and use word meanings in three real-world tasks: indoor navigation, spatial language video retrieval, and mobile manipulation.},

Here, we describe central aspects of language use by robots, including understanding natural language requests, using language to drive learning about the physical world, and engaging in collaborative dialogue with a human partner. We describe common approaches, roughly divided into learning methods, logic-based methods, and methods that focus on questions of human--robot interaction.

In this article, we introduce the KNOWROB knowledge processing system that is specifically designed to provide autonomous robots with the knowledge needed for performing everyday manipulation tasks. The system allows the realization of ``virtual knowledge bases'': collections of knowledge pieces that are not explicitly represented but computed on demand from the robot's internal data structures, its perception system, or external sources of information. This article gives an overview of the different kinds of knowledge, the different inference mechanisms, and interfaces for acquiring knowledge from external sources, such as the robot's perception system, observations of human activities, Web sites on the Internet, as well as Web-based knowledge bases for information exchange between robots. We evaluate the system's scalability and present different integrated experiments that show its versatility and comprehensiveness.},

These methods have to supply the difference between the (often shallow and symbolic) information in the instructions and the (detailed, grounded and often real-valued) information needed for execution. For filling these information gaps, a robot first has to identify them in the instructions, reason about suitable information sources, and combine pieces of information from different sources and of different structure into a coherent knowledge base. To this end we propose the KnowRob knowledge processing system for robots. In this article, we discuss why the requirements of a robot knowledge processing system differ from what is commonly investigated in AI research, and propose to re-consider a KR system as a semantically annotated view on information and algorithms that are often already available as part of the robot's control system. We then introduce representational structures and a common vocabulary for representing knowledge about robot actions, events, objects, environments, and the robot's hardware as well as inference procedures that operate on this common representation. The KnowRob system has been released as open-source software and is being used on several robots performing complex object manipulation tasks. We evaluate it through prototypical queries that demonstrate the expressive power and its impact on the robot's performance.},

The period between completion of development and full capacity utilization is known as production ramp-up. During that time, the new production process is ill understood, which causes low yields and low production rates. This paper analyzes the interactions among capacity utilization, yields, and process improvement (learning). We model learning in the form of deliberate experiments, which reduce capacity in the short run. This creates a trade-off between experiments and production. High selling prices during ramp-up raise the opportunity cost of experiments, yet early learning is more valuable than later learning. We formalize the resulting intertemporal trade-off between the short-term opportunity cost of capacity and the long term value of learning as a dynamic program. The paper also examines the tradeoff between production speed and yield/quality, where faster production rates lead to more defects. Finally, we show what happens if managers misunderstand the sources of learning.},

  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to develop a simple experimental methodology for the joint stiffness identification and its application to any robot and also to prove a methods already present in bibliography. The estimation of stiffness parameters of a robot is of paramount importance for the precision of movement, in fact in the last year the application of robots is justified by many factors, one of these factors is the high precision of movement. The aim of this thesis is to develop a simple experimental methodology for the joint stiffness identification and its application to any robot and also to prove a methods already present in bibliography.  The case study in this work is a lightweight robot, namely the UR5 manipulators. Usually these robots are slender and low-weight, and provided with flexible joints, these characteristics shall make a modal analysis of fundamental importance, because the robots that present a high flexibility may generate vibratory phenomenon, that would affect its performance. Therefore the stiffness analysis is the basis and preliminary of modal analysis. The stiffness analysis was made necessary by the lack of knowledge of some UR5 robot parameters as the stiffness, as this thesis' case, or even damping.  In the first three chapters there are, respectively, an introduction on the factors that influence the stiffness in the robotic structures; then are provided all the physical and mathematical knowledges, which underlie the study of stiffness, and finally is illustrated the state of art in stiffness evaluation methods.  In the last three chapters there are, respectively, an overview of all components that have been used in laboratory for the evaluation of stiffness, subsequently the value of stiffness are presented respectively through the adopted methodology and the developed methodology, as final step an analysis of results was conducted to compare and to analyze the two methods.  Some fundamental conclusions of this work are, respectively, that for conduct an analysis of stiffness is necessary a measurement system with high accuracy, subsequently both the adopted method and developed method may be applied in particular configurations, where the Jacobian matrix don't change following the load application.},

The present structured literature analysis examines \$\$n = 236\$\$articles on the requirements for the explainability and acceptance of AI. Results include a comprehensive review of \$\$n = 48\$\$articles on information people need to perceive an AI as explainable, the information needed to accept an AI, and representation and interaction methods promoting trust in an AI. Results indicate that the two main groups of users are developers who require information about the internal operations of the model and end users who require information about AI results or behavior. Users' information needs vary in specificity, complexity, and urgency and must consider context, domain knowledge, and the user's cognitive resources. The acceptance of AI systems depends on information about the system's functions and performance, privacy and ethical considerations, as well as goal-supporting information tailored to individual preferences and information to establish trust in the system. Information about the system's limitations and potential failures can increase acceptance and trust. Trusted interaction methods are human-like, including natural language, speech, text, and visual representations such as graphs, charts, and animations. Our results have significant implications for future human-centric AI systems being developed. Thus, they are suitable as input for further application-specific investigations of user needs.},

  abstract = {Learning to understand and infer object functionalities is an important step towards robust visual intelligence. Significant research efforts have recently focused on segmenting the object parts that enable specific types of human-object interaction, the so-called "object affordances". However, most works treat it as a static semantic segmentation problem, focusing solely on object appearance and relying on strong supervision and object detection. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the spatio-temporal nature of human-object interaction for affordance segmentation. In particular, we design an autoencoder that is trained using ground-truth labels of only the last frame of the sequence, and is able to infer pixel-wise affordance labels in both videos and static images. Our model surpasses the need for object labels and bounding boxes by using a soft-attention mechanism that enables the implicit localization of the interaction hotspot. For evaluation purposes, we introduce the SOR3D-AFF corpus, which consists of human-object interaction sequences and supports 9 types of affordances in terms of pixel-wise annotation, covering typical manipulations of tool-like objects. We show that our model achieves competitive results compared to strongly supervised methods on SOR3D-AFF, while being able to predict affordances for similar unseen objects in two affordance image-only datasets.},

The language offers three different level of abstraction for robot programming. On lowest level skills are coded by domain experts. On a more abstract level these skills are supposed to be combined by shop floor workers or technicians to define tasks. The language is designed to allow as much flexibility as necessary on the lowest level of abstraction and is kept as simple as possible with the more abstract layers. A Statechart like model is used to describe the different levels of detail. For this we apply the UML/P and the language workbench MontiCore. To this end we are able to generate code while hiding controller specific implementation details. In addition the development in LightRocks is supported by a generic graphical editor implemented as an Eclipse plugin.},

In this paper, we build perceptual models that use haptic, auditory, and proprioceptive data acquired through robot exploratory behaviors to go beyond vision. Our system learns to ground natural language words describing objects using supervision from an interactive humanrobot "I Spy" game. In this game, the human and robot take turns describing one object among several, then trying to guess which object the other has described. All supervision labels were gathered from human participants physically present to play this game with a robot. We demonstrate that our multi-modal system for grounding natural language outperforms a traditional, vision-only grounding framework by comparing the two on the "I Spy" task. We also provide a qualitative analysis of the groundings learned in the game, visualizing what words are understood better with multimodal sensory information as well as identifying learned word meanings that correlate with physical object properties (e.g. 'small' negatively correlates with object weight).}

Success in those and other realms has brought this machine-learning technique from obscurity in the early 2000s to dominance today. {$\bullet$} Although deep learning's rise to fame is relatively recent, its origins are not. In 1958, back when mainframe computers filled rooms and ran on vacuum tubes, knowledge of the interconnections between neurons in the brain inspired Frank Rosenblatt at Cornell to design the first artificial neural network, which he presciently described as a ``pattern-recognizing device.'' But Rosenblatt's ambitions outpaced the capabilities of his era---and he knew it. Even his inaugural paper was forced to acknowledge the voracious appetite of neural networks for computational power, bemoaning that ``as the number of connections in the network increases{\dots}the burden on a conventional digital computer soon becomes excessive.'' {$\bullet$} Fortunately for such artificial neural networks---later rechristened ``deep learning'' when they included extra layers of neurons---decades of Moore's Law and other improvements in computer hardware yielded a roughly 10-million-fold increase in the number of computations that a computer could do in a second. So when researchers returned to deep learning in the late 2000s, they wielded tools equal to the challenge.},

We use a cloud-based framework called Human Augmented Robotic Intelligence (HARI) to perform gesture recognition of the human demonstrator and gesture control of a local humanoid robot, named Pepper. To ensure that the system is real-time, we design a system to maximize cloud computation contribution to the deep-neural-network-based gesture recognition system, OpenPose, and to minimize communication costs between the cloud and the robot. A hybrid control system is used to hide latency caused by either routing or physical distances. We conducted real-time semaphore mirroring experiments in which both the robots and the demonstrator were located in Tokyo, Japan, whereas the cloud server was deployed in the United States. The total latency was 400ms for the video streaming to the cloud and 108ms for the robot commanding from the cloud. Further, we measured the reliability of our gesture-based semaphore recognition system with two human subjects, and were able to achieve 90\% and 76.7\% recognition accuracy, respectively, for the two subjects with open-loop when the subjects were not allowed to see the recognition results. We could achieve 100\% recognition accuracy when both subjects were allowed to adapt to the recognition system under a closed-loop setting. Lastly, we showed that we can support two humanoid robots with a single server at the same time. With this real-time cloud-based HRI system, we illustrate that we can deploy gesture-based human-robot globally and at scale.}

With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to \$1.5\$cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment. To our knowledge, this is the first successful transfer of a deep neural network trained only on simulated RGB images (without pre-training on real images) to the real world for the purpose of robotic control.},

The last several years have seen a sharp resurgence in the orders of industrial robots in China, and the areas addressed within industrial robotics has extended into safety-critical domains. However, safety standards have not yet been implemented widely in academia and engineering applications, particularly in robot software development. This paper presents a systematic analysis of functional safety certification practices in software development for the safety-critical software of industrial robots, to identify the safety certification practices used for the development of industrial robots in China and how these practices comply with the safety standard requirements. Reviewing from Chinese academic papers, our research shows that safety standards are barely used in software development of industrial robot. The majority of the papers propose various solutions to achieve safety, but only about two thirds of the papers refer to non-standardized approaches that mainly address the systematic level rather than the software development level. In addition, our research shows that with the development of artificial intelligent, an emerging field is still on the quest for standardized and suitable approaches to develop safety-critical software.}

  abstract = {This dissertation presents a new technique, based on dynamically coupled particle systems, for creating and manipulating complex three dimensional shapes in a fluid like manner. The most novel feature of this approach to shape representation is the use of self organizing primitive elements. In the simplest case, these primitive elements, or particles, each posses state variables of position and mass, and the system of elements interact through pairwise potential energy functions. More complex systems include additional state variables combined with simple heuristics to create application specific behavior. The ability of these systems to self organize provides a representation technique which exhibits dynamically changing structure, an attribute not found in popular spline and polygonally based representations. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach it is applied to the following problems: free form shape modeling, computer assisted animation, and surface reconstruction. For free-form modeling the approach supports smoothness constraints similar to those inherent in the deformation energies of popular, elastic surface models. Unlike spline patches or parameterized surface models, the model does not attempt to enforce analytical continuity conditions, such as tangent or curvature continuity over the surface. Applied to computer assisted animation the approach computes the movement and deformation of models mimicking, at a rudimentary level, the physical behavior of flexible solids and fluids. Applied to surface reconstruction, these systems can infer surface structure from sparse data sets, without a prior knowledge of the surface structure or the topological genus. In summary, dynamically coupled particle systems provide an useful alternative to traditional shape representation and manipulation techniques.},

  abstract = {Parameterized movement primitives have been extensively used for imitation learning of robotic tasks. However, the high-dimensionality of the parameter space hinders the improvement of such primitives in the reinforcement learning (RL) setting, especially for learning with physical robots. In this paper we propose a novel view on handling the demonstrated trajectories for acquiring low-dimensional, non-linear latent dynamics, using mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA) on the movements' parameter space. Moreover, we introduce a new contextual off-policy RL algorithm, named LAtent-Movements Policy Optimization (LAMPO). LAMPO can provide gradient estimates from previous experience using self-normalized importance sampling, hence, making full use of samples collected in previous learning iterations. These advantages combined provide a complete framework for sample-efficient off-policy optimization of movement primitives for robot learning of high-dimensional manipulation skills. Our experimental results conducted both in simulation and on a real robot show that LAMPO provides sample-efficient policies against common approaches in literature.

In this case we should leverage optimization methods to inform search over potential action sequences. We propose to formulate the problem holistically as a 1st- order logic extension of a mathematical program: a non-linear constrained program over the full world trajectory where the symbolic state-action sequence defines the (in-)equality constraints. We tackle the challenge of solving such programs by proposing three levels of approximation: The coarsest level introduces the concept of the effective end state kinematics, parametrically describing all possible end state configurations conditional to a given symbolic action sequence. Optimization on this level is fast and can inform symbolic search. The other two levels optimize over interaction keyframes and eventually over the full world trajectory across interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a problem of maximizing the height of a physically stable construction from an assortment of boards, cylinders and blocks.},

This joint optimization problem can be framed as a logic-geometric program. Existing solvers lack several features (such as consistently handling kinematic switches) and efficiency to handle the cooperative manipulation domain. We propose a new approximate solver scheme, combining ideas from branch-and-bound and MCTS and exploiting multiple levels of bounds to better direct the search. We demonstrate the method in a scenario where a Baxter robot needs to help a human to reach for objects.},

Then, we leverage that knowledge of people by using it to predict what a person will do in different situations; e.g., that a person may forget something and may need to be reminded or that a person cannot see everything the robot sees. We also discuss methods of how to evaluate a cognitive architecture and show numerous empirically validated examples of ACT-R/E models.},

We show through a case study that a 3 1/2 year old child can, in fact, play a credible game of hide and seek, even though she does not seem to have perspective taking ability. We propose that children are able to learn how to play hide and seek by learning the features and relations of objects (e.g., containment, under) and use that information to play a credible game of hide and seek. We model this hypothesis within the ACT-R cognitive architecture and put the model on a robot, which is able to mimic the child's hiding behavior. We also take the "hiding" model and use it as the basis for a "seeking" model. We suggest that using the same representations and procedures that a person uses allows better interaction between the human and robotic system.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models have demonstrated outstanding performance in several problems, but their training process tends to require immense amounts of computational and human resources for training and labeling, constraining the types of problems that can be tackled. Therefore, the design of effective training methods that require small labeled training sets is an important research direction that will allow a more effective use of resources.Among current approaches designed to address this issue, two are particularly interesting: data augmentation and active learning. Data augmentation achieves this goal by artificially generating new training points, while active learning relies on the selection of the "most informative" subset of unlabeled training samples to be labelled by an oracle. Although successful in practice, data augmentation can waste computational resources because it indiscriminately generates samples that are not guaranteed to be informative, and active learning selects a small subset of informative samples (from a large un-annotated set) that may be insufficient for the training process. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian generative active deep learning approach that combines active learning with data augmentation -- we provide theoretical and empirical evidence (MNIST, CIFAR-\${\textbackslash}\{10,100{\textbackslash}\}\$, and SVHN) that our approach has more efficient training and better classification results than data augmentation and active learning.},

One of the key challenges of synthetic data, to date, has been to bridge the so-called reality gap, so that networks trained on synthetic data operate correctly when exposed to real-world data. We explore the reality gap in the context of 6-DoF pose estimation of known objects from a single RGB image. We show that for this problem the reality gap can be successfully spanned by a simple combination of domain randomized and photorealistic data. Using synthetic data generated in this manner, we introduce a one-shot deep neural network that is able to perform competitively against a state-of-the-art network trained on a combination of real and synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first deep network trained only on synthetic data that is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 6-DoF object pose estimation. Our network also generalizes better to novel environments including extreme lighting conditions, for which we show qualitative results. Using this network we demonstrate a real-time system estimating object poses with sufficient accuracy for real-world semantic grasping of known household objects in clutter by a real robot.},

  abstract = {Background Anastomotic leak, a potentially deadly postoperative occurrence, particularly interests surgeons performing gastrointestinal procedures. We investigated incidence, cost, and impact on survival of anastomotic leak in gastrointestinal surgical procedures at an academic center. Study Design We conducted a chart review of American College of Surgeons NSQIP operative procedures with gastrointestinal anastomosis from January 1, 2003 through April 30, 2006. Each case with an American College of Surgeons NSQIP 30-day postoperative complication was systematically reviewed for evidence of anastomotic leak for 12 months after the operative date. We tracked patients for up to 10 years to determine survival. Morbidity, mortality, and cost for patients with gastrointestinal anastomotic leaks were compared with patients with anastomoses that remained intact. Results Unadjusted analyses revealed significant differences between patients who had anastomotic leaks develop and those who did not: morbidity (98.0\% vs 28.4\%; p {$<$} 0.0001), length of stay (13 vs 5 days; p {$\leq$} 0.0001), 30-day mortality (8.4\% vs 2.5\%; p {$<$} 0.0001), long-term mortality (36.4\% vs 20.0\%; p {$\leq$} 0.0001), and hospital costs (chi-square [2]~= 359.8; p {$<$} 0.0001). Multivariable regression demonstrated that anastomotic leak was associated with congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR]~= 31.5; 95\% CI, 2.6--381.4; p~= 0.007), peripheral vascular disease (OR~= 4.6; 95\% CI, 1.0--20.5; p~= 0.048), alcohol abuse (OR~= 3.7; 95\% CI, 1.6--8.3; p~= 0.002), steroid use~(OR~= 2.3; 95\% CI: 1.1--5.0; p~= 0.027), abnormal sodium (OR~= 0.4; 95\% CI, 0.2--0.7; p~= 0.002), weight loss (OR~= 0.2; 95\% CI, 0.06--0.7; p~= 0.011), and location of anastomosis: rectum (OR~= 14.0; 95\% CI, 2.6--75.5; p~= 0.002), esophagus (OR~= 13.0; 95\% CI, 3.6--46.2; p {$<$} 0.0001), pancreas (OR~= 12.4; 95\% CI, 3.3--46.2; p {$<$} 0.0001), small intestine (OR~= 6.9; 95\% CI, 1.8--26.4; p~= 0.005), and colon (OR~= 5.2; 95\% CI, 1.5--17.7; p~=~0.009). Conclusions Significant morbidity, mortality, and cost accompany gastrointestinal anastomotic leaks. Patients who experience an anastomotic leak have lower rates of survival at 30 days and long term.}

They can be used to represent point-to-point and periodic movements and can be applied in Cartesian or in joint space. One problem that arises when DMPs are used to define control policies in Cartesian space is that there exists no minimal, singularity-free representation of orientation. In this paper we show how dynamic movement primitives can be defined for non minimal, singularity free representations of orientation, such as rotation matrices and quaternions. All of the advantages of DMPs, including ease of learning, the ability to include coupling terms, and scale and temporal invariance, can be adopted in our formulation. We have also proposed a new phase stopping mechanism to ensure full movement reproduction in case of perturbations.},

The researcher's focus is shifting towards this area due to its vast range of real-life applications to assist in daily living. Therefore, it is necessary to validate its performance on standard benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art systems before applying it in real-life applications. The primary objective of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to collect existing research on video-based human activity recognition, summarize, and analyze the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures regarding various methodologies, challenges, and issues. The top five scientific databases (such as ACM, IEEE, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Taylor \& Francis) are accessed to accompany this systematic study by summarizing 70 different research articles on human activity recognition after critical review. Human activity recognition in videos is a challenging problem due to its diverse and complex nature. For accurate video classification, extraction of both spatial and temporal features from video sequences is essential. Therefore, this SLR focuses on reviewing the recent advancements in stratified self-deriving feature-based deep learning architectures. Furthermore, it explores various deep learning techniques available for HAR, challenges researchers to face to build a robust model, and state-of-the-art datasets used for evaluation. This SLR intends to provide a baseline for video-based human activity recognition research while emphasizing several challenges regarding human activity recognition accuracy in video sequences using deep neural architectures.},

  abstract = {Deep convolutional networks have become a popular tool for image generation and restoration. Generally, their excellent performance is imputed to their ability to learn realistic image priors from a large number of example images. In this paper, we show that, on the contrary, the structure of a generator network is sufficient to capture a great deal of low-level image statistics prior to any learning. In order to do so, we show that a randomly-initialized neural network can be used as a handcrafted prior with excellent results in standard inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting. Furthermore, the same prior can be used to invert deep neural representations to diagnose them, and to restore images based on flash-no flash input pairs. Apart from its diverse applications, our approach highlights the inductive bias captured by standard generator network architectures. It also bridges the gap between two very popular families of image restoration methods: learning-based methods using deep convolutional networks and learning-free methods based on handcrafted image priors such as self-similarity (Code and supplementary material are available at https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep\_image\_prior).},

  abstract = {In several realistic domains an agent's behavior is composed of multiple interdependent skills. For example, consider a humanoid robot that must play soccer, as is the focus of this paper. In order to succeed, it is clear that the robot needs to walk quickly, turn sharply, and kick the ball far. However, these individual skills are ineffective if the robot falls down when switching from walking to turning, or if it cannot position itself behind the ball for a kick.    This paper presents a learning architecture for a humanoid robot soccer agent that has been fully deployed and tested within the RoboCup 3D simulation environment. First, we demonstrate that individual skills such as walking and turning can be parameterized and optimized to match the best performance statistics reported in the literature. These results are achieved through effective use of the CMA-ES optimization algorithm. Next, we describe a framework for optimizing skills in conjunction with one another, a little-understood problem with substantial practical significance. Over several phases of learning, a total of roughly 100--150 parameters are optimized. Detailed experiments show that an agent thus optimized performs comparably with the top teams from the RoboCup 2010 competitions, while taking relatively few man-hours for development.}

  abstract = {Learning robot tasks or controllers using deep reinforcement learning has been proven effective in simulations. Learning in simulation has several advantages. For example, one can fully control the simulated environment, including halting motions while performing computations. Another advantage when robots are involved, is that the amount of time a robot is occupied learning a task---rather than being productive---can be reduced by transferring the learned task to the real robot. Transfer learning requires some amount of fine-tuning on the real robot. For tasks which involve complex (non-linear) dynamics, the fine-tuning itself may take a substantial amount of time. In order to reduce the amount of fine-tuning we propose to learn robustified controllers in simulation. Robustified controllers are learned by exploiting the ability to change simulation parameters (both appearance and dynamics) for successive training episodes. An additional benefit for this approach is that it alleviates the precise determination of physics parameters for the simulator, which is a non-trivial task. We demonstrate our proposed approach on a real setup in which a robot aims to solve a maze game, which involves complex dynamics due to static friction and potentially large accelerations. We show that the amount of fine-tuning in transfer learning for a robustified controller is substantially reduced compared to a non-robustified controller.},

This occurs frequently in engineering and science domains where a simulator is used as a generative model of data, but the likelihood of the generated data is not known and is intractable. Given observed data, we combine the idea of hierarchical Bayesian modeling, empirical Bayes, and neural density estimation with normalizing flow to first learn a surrogate approximation of the model likelihood and then, to learn a prior distribution over the model parameters. The learned prior and the surrogate likelihood further allow to learn a posterior distribution for each observation. This is a general approach to likelihood-free inference, and is especially useful in settings where the simulator is too costly to run at inference time. We show the applicability of our methods on a real physical problem from high energy physics (HEP).},

  abstract = {The AI community is increasingly putting its attention towards combining symbolic and neural approaches, as it is often argued that the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are complementary. One recent trend in the literature is weakly supervised learning techniques that employ operators from fuzzy logics. In particular, these use prior background knowledge described in such logics to help the training of a neural network from unlabeled and noisy data. By interpreting logical symbols using neural networks, this background knowledge can be added to regular loss functions, hence making reasoning a part of learning. We study, both formally and empirically, how a large collection of logical operators from the fuzzy logic literature behave in a differentiable learning setting. We find that many of these operators, including some of the most well-known, are highly unsuitable in this setting. A further finding concerns the treatment of implication in these fuzzy logics, and shows a strong imbalance between gradients driven by the antecedent and the consequent of the implication. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of fuzzy implications (called sigmoidal implications) to tackle this phenomenon. Finally, we empirically show that it is possible to use Differentiable Fuzzy Logics for semi-supervised learning, and compare how different operators behave in practice. We find that, to achieve the largest performance improvement over a supervised baseline, we have to resort to non-standard combinations of logical operators which perform well in learning, but no longer satisfy the usual logical laws.},

Extension of the model to practical robotic applications have been traditionally limited by the lack of good response in textureless areas in the case of conventional inexpensive stereo cameras as well as by the need for expensive laser based sensor systems to compensate for this deficiency. The recent availability of RGB-D sensors such as the PrimeSense sensor has opened new avenues for practical usage of these sensors for robotic applications such as grasping. In this paper, we present novel algorithms for segmentation of objects and parts from range images with extensions based on semantic cues to yield robust part detection. The detected parts are then parameterized using a superquadric based fitting framework and classified into one of different generic shapes. The categorization of the parts enables rules for grasping the object. This Grasping by Components (GBC) scheme is a natural extension of the RBC framework and provides a scalable framework for grasping of objects. This scheme also permits the grasping of novel objects in the scene, with at least one known grasp affordance.},

This has lead to state-of-the-art performance being achieved across several---previously disconnected---problem domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning and generative modelling. These success stories nearly universally go hand-in-hand with availability of immense quantities of labelled training examples ("big data") exhibiting simple grid-like structure (e.g. text or images), exploitable through convolutional or recurrent layers. This is due to the extremely large number of degrees-of-freedom in neural networks, leaving their generalisation ability vulnerable to effects such as overfitting. However, there remain many domains where extensive data gathering is not always appropriate, affordable, or even feasible. Furthermore, data is generally organised in more complicated kinds of structure---which most existing approaches would simply discard. Examples of such tasks are abundant in the biomedical space; with e.g. small numbers of subjects available for any given clinical study, or relationships between proteins specified via interaction networks. I hypothesise that, if deep learning is to reach its full potential in such environments, we need to reconsider "hard-coded" approaches---integrating assumptions about inherent structure in the input data directly into our architectures and learning algorithms, through structural inductive biases. In this dissertation, I directly validate this hypothesis by developing three structure-infused neural network architectures (operating on sparse multimodal and graph-structured data), and a structure-informed learning algorithm for graph neural networks, demonstrating significant outperformance of conventional baseline models and algorithms.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of programmatic reinforcement learning, in which policies are represented as short programs in a symbolic language. Programmatic policies can be more interpretable, generalizable, and amenable to formal verification than neural policies; however, designing rigorous learning approaches for such policies remains a challenge. Our approach to this challenge - a meta-algorithm called PROPEL - is based on three insights. First, we view our learning task as optimization in policy space, modulo the constraint that the desired policy has a programmatic representation, and solve this optimization problem using a form of mirror descent that takes a gradient step into the unconstrained policy space and then projects back onto the constrained space.  Second, we view the unconstrained policy space as mixing neural and programmatic representations, which enables employing state-of-the-art deep policy gradient approaches.  Third, we cast the projection step as program synthesis via imitation learning, and exploit contemporary combinatorial methods for this task. We present theoretical convergence results for PROPEL and empirically evaluate the approach in three continuous control domains. The experiments show that PROPEL can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches for learning programmatic policies.}

We seek to amortize the solution over a set of relevant parameters in an offline stage to enable rapid decision-making and be able to react to changes in the parameter in the online stage. To tackle the curse of dimensionality arising when the state and/or parameter are high-dimensional, we represent the policy using neural networks. We compare two training paradigms: First, our model-based approach leverages the dynamics and definition of the objective function to learn the value function of the parameterized optimal control problem and obtain the policy using a feedback form. Second, we use actor-critic reinforcement learning to approximate the policy in a data-driven way. Using an example involving a two-dimensional convection-diffusion equation, which features high-dimensional state and parameter spaces, we investigate the accuracy and efficiency of both training paradigms. While both paradigms lead to a reasonable approximation of the policy, the model-based approach is more accurate and considerably reduces the number of PDE solves.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Prospection lies at the core of cognition: it is the means by which an agent -- a person or a cognitive robot -- shifts its perspective from immediate sensory experience to anticipate future events, be they the actions of other agents or the outcome of its own actions. Prospection, accomplished by internal simulation, requires mechanisms for both perceptual imagery and motor imagery. While it is known that these two forms of imagery are tightly entwined in the mirror neuron system, we do not yet have an effective model of the mentalizing network which would provide a framework to integrate declarative episodic and procedural memory systems and to combine experiential knowledge with skillful know-how. Such a framework would be founded on joint perceptuo-motor representations. In this paper, we examine the case for this form of representation, contrasting sensory-motor theory with ideo-motor theory, and we discuss how such a framework could be realized by joint episodic-procedural memory. We argue that such a representation framework has several advantages for cognitive robots. Since episodic memory operates by recombining imperfectly recalled past experience, this allows it to simulate new or unexpected events. Furthermore, by virtue of its associative nature, joint episodic-procedural memory allows the internal simulation to be conditioned by current context, semantic memory, and the agent's value system. Context and semantics constrain the combinatorial explosion of potential perception-action associations and allow effective action selection in the pursuit of goals, while the value system provides the motives that underpin the agent's autonomy and cognitive development. This joint episodic-procedural memory framework is neutral regarding the final implementation of these episodic and procedural memories, which can be configured sub-symbolically as associative networks or symbolically as content-addressable image databases and databases of motor-control scripts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In contrast to previous research in this area that deals with absolute accuracy, this article is focused on determining achievable repeatability. To unify and to increase the robot repeatability, the measurements with highly accurate sensors were performed under different conditions on an industrial robot ABB IRB1200, which was equipped with thermal sensors, mounted on a pre-defined position around joints. The performed measurements allowed to implement a temperature-based prediction model of the end effector positioning error. Subsequent tests have shown that the implemented model used for the error compensation proved to be highly effective. Using the methodology presented in this article, the impact of drift can be reduced by up to 89.9\%. A robot upgraded with a compensation principle described in this article does not have to be warmed up as it works with the same low repeatability error in the entire range of the achievable temperatures.},

This work presents a user study in which participants were asked to teach the robot Pepper a game of skill. The robot was equipped with a state-of-the-art skill learning method, based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). The only feedback participants could give was a discrete rating after each of Pepper's movement executions (``very good,'' ``good,'' ``average,'' ``not so good,'' ``not good at all''). We compare the learning performance of the robot when applying user-provided feedback with a version of the learning where an objectively determined cost via hand-coded cost function and external tracking system is applied. Our findings suggest that (a) an intuitive graphical user interface for providing discrete feedback can be used for robot learning of complex movement skills when using DMP-based optimization, making the tedious definition of a cost function obsolete; and (b) un-experienced users with no knowledge about the learning algorithm naturally tend to apply a working rating strategy, leading to similar learning performance as when using the objectively determined cost. We discuss insights about difficulties when learning from user provided feedback, and make suggestions how learning continuous movement skills from non-expert humans could be improved.},

  abstract = {Biological neurons use short and sudden increases in voltage to send information. These signals are more commonly known as action potentials, spikes or pulses. Recent neurological research has shown that neurons encode information in the timing of single spikes, and not only just in their average firing frequency. This paper gives an introduction to spiking neural networks, some biological background, and will present two models of spiking neurons that employ pulse coding. Networks of spiking neurons are more powerful than their non-spiking predecessors as they can encode temporal information in their signals, but therefore do also need different and biologically more plausible rules for synaptic plasticity. You constantly receive sensory input from your environ-ment. You process this information, recognizing food or dan-ger, and take appropriate actions. Not only you; anything that interacts with its environment needs to do so. Mimicking such a seemingly simple mechanism in a robot proofs to be insanely difficult. Nature must laugh at our feeble attempts; animals perform this behaviour with apparent ease. The reason for this mind-boggling performance lies in their neural structure or 'brain'. Millions and millions of neurons are interconnected with each other and cooperate to efficiently process incoming signals and decide on actions. A typical neuron sends its signals out to over 10.000 other neu-rons, making it clear to even to inexpert reader that the signal flow is rather complicated. To put it mildly: we do not under-stand the brain that well yet. In fact, we do not even com-pletely understand the functioning of a single neuron. The chemical activity of the synapse already proves to be infi-nitely more complex than firstly assumed. However, the rough concept of how neurons work is un-derstood: neurons send out short pulses of electrical energy as signals, if they have received enough of these themselves. This basically simple mechanism has been moulded into a mathematical model for computer use. Artificial as these computerised neurons are, we refer to them as networks of artificial neurons, or artificial neural networks. We will sketch a short history of these now; the biological back-ground of the real neuron will be drawn in the next chapter. Generations of artificial neurons}

Although programming robotic applications requires specialist knowledge, a robot software environment should support convenient development while maintaining full flexibility needed when realizing challenging robotics tasks. In addition, several desirable properties should be fulfilled, such as robustness, reusability of existing programs, and skill transfer between robots. In this work, we introduce the ArmarX statechart concept, which is used for describing control and data flow of robot programs. This event-driven statechart approach of ArmarX helps realizing important features such as increased robustness through distributed program execution, convenient programming through graphical user interfaces, and versatility by interweaving dynamic statechart structure with custom user-code.

The majority of surgical robots nowadays are telemanipulators without autonomous capabilities. Autonomous systems have been developed for laparoscopic camera guidance, however following simple rules and not adapting their behavior to specific tasks, procedures, or surgeons. METHODS: The herein presented methodology allows different robot kinematics to perceive their environment, interpret it according to a knowledge base and perform context-aware actions. For training, twenty operations were conducted with human camera guidance by a single surgeon. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluated the cognitive robotic camera control. A VIKY~EP system and a KUKA LWR 4 robot were trained on data from manual camera guidance after completion of the surgeon's learning curve. Second, only data from VIKY EP were used to train the LWR and finally data from training with the LWR were used to re-train the LWR. RESULTS: The duration of each operation decreased with the robot's increasing experience from 1704~s\,{\textpm}\,244~s to 1406~s\,{\textpm}\,112~s, and 1197~s. Camera guidance quality (good/neutral/poor) improved from 38.6/53.4/7.9 to 49.4/46.3/4.1\% and 56.2/41.0/2.8\%. CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive camera robot improved its performance with experience, laying the foundation for a new generation of cognitive surgical robots that adapt to a surgeon's needs.},

With Surgomics, we aim to facilitate personalized therapy recommendations in surgery by integration of intraoperative surgical data and their analysis with machine learning methods to leverage the potential of this data in analogy to Radiomics and Genomics. METHODS: We defined Surgomics as the entirety of surgomic features that are process characteristics of a surgical procedure automatically derived from multimodal intraoperative data to quantify processes in the operating room. In a multidisciplinary team we discussed potential data sources like endoscopic videos, vital sign monitoring, medical devices and instruments and respective surgomic features. Subsequently, an online questionnaire was sent to experts from surgery and (computer) science at multiple centers for rating the features' clinical relevance and technical feasibility. RESULTS: In total, 52 surgomic features were identified and assigned to eight feature categories. Based on the expert survey (n\,=\,66 participants) the feature category with the highest clinical relevance as rated by surgeons was "surgical skill and quality of performance" for morbidity and mortality (9.0\,{\textpm}\,1.3 on a numerical rating scale from 1 to 10) as well as for long-term (oncological) outcome (8.2\,{\textpm}\,1.8). The feature category with the highest feasibility to be automatically extracted as rated by (computer) scientists was "Instrument" (8.5\,{\textpm}\,1.7). Among the surgomic features ranked as most relevant in their respective category were "intraoperative adverse events", "action performed with instruments", "vital sign monitoring", and "difficulty of surgery". CONCLUSION: Surgomics is a promising concept for the analysis of intraoperative data. Surgomics may be used together with preoperative features from clinical data and Radiomics to predict postoperative morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome, as well as to provide tailored feedback for surgeons.},

The paper proposes easy-to-customize input prompts for ChatGPT that meet common requirements in practical applications, such as easy integration with robot execution systems and applicability to various environments while minimizing the impact of ChatGPT's token limit. The prompts encourage ChatGPT to output a sequence of predefined robot actions, represent the operating environment in a formalized style, and infer the updated state of the operating environment. Experiments confirmed that the proposed prompts enable ChatGPT to act according to requirements in various environments, and users can adjust ChatGPT's output with natural language feedback for safe and robust operation.

  abstract = {This paper introduces DiffTOP, a new policy class for reinforcement learning and imitation learning that utilizes differentiable trajectory optimization to generate the policy actions. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end, e.g., using the policy gradient loss in reinforcement learning, or using the imitation loss in imitation learning. When applied to model-based reinforcement learning, DiffTOP addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTOP is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. When applied to imitation learning, DiffTOP performs test-time trajectory optimization to compute the actions with a learned cost function, outperforming prior methods that only perform forward passes of the policy network to generate actions. We benchmark DiffTOP on 15 model-based RL tasks, and 13 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, and show that it outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.},

  abstract = {Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.},

  abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) agents, capable of performing a broad range of actions, such as invoking tools and controlling robots, show great potential in tackling real-world challenges. LLM agents are typically prompted to produce actions by generating JSON or text in a pre-defined format, which is usually limited by constrained action space (e.g., the scope of pre-defined tools) and restricted flexibility (e.g., inability to compose multiple tools). This work proposes to use executable Python code to consolidate LLM agents' actions into a unified action space (CodeAct). Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct can execute code actions and dynamically revise prior actions or emit new actions upon new observations through multi-turn interactions. Our extensive analysis of 17 LLMs on API-Bank and a newly curated benchmark shows that CodeAct outperforms widely used alternatives (up to 20\% higher success rate). The encouraging performance of CodeAct motivates us to build an open-source LLM agent that interacts with environments by executing interpretable code and collaborates with users using natural language. To this end, we collect an instruction-tuning dataset CodeActInstruct that consists of 7k multi-turn interactions using CodeAct. We show that it can be used with existing data to improve models in agent-oriented tasks without compromising their general capability. CodeActAgent, finetuned from Llama2 and Mistral, is integrated with Python interpreter and uniquely tailored to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., model training) using existing libraries and autonomously self-debug.},

  abstract = {Machine learning systems generally assume that the training and testing distributions are the same. To this end, a key requirement is to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e., out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category. Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets, applications, and our open-sourced codebase for fair evaluation. Finally, we summarize existing literature and present some potential research topics for the future.},

  abstract = {Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scene-level diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models' (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GenSim, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25\%.

In the offline phase, we adopt Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the deformation dynamics purely from the simulation data.

The traditional fabrication approach for prostheses or orthoses is a material-wasting, time-consuming, and labor-intensive process. Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has advantages that can solve these problems. Many trials have been conducted in fabricating prostheses and orthoses. However, there is still a gap between the hype and the expected realities of AM in prosthetic and orthotic clinics. One of the key challenges is the lack of a systematic framework of integrated technologies with the AM procedure; another challenge is the need to design a prosthetic or orthotic product that can meet the requirements of both comfort and function. This study reviews the current state of application of AM technologies in prosthesis and orthosis fabrication, and discusses optimal design using computational methods and biomechanical evaluations of product performance. A systematic framework of the AM procedure is proposed, which covers the scanning of affected body parts through to the final designed adaptable product. A cycle of optimal design and biomechanical evaluation of products using finite-element analysis is included in the framework. A mature framework of the AM procedure and sufficient evidence that the resulting products show satisfactory biomechanical performance will promote the application of AM in prosthetic and orthotic clinics.},

In this study, we conduct a review of recent studies about code generation with LLMs, from the application of LLM-based code generation to the evaluation of LLM-generated code. We find, with the powerful code understanding and writing ability LLMs provide, these novel techniques can be applied to manage various software engineering tasks, and indeed boost the productivity of developers to a great extent. But we also find, as an equally important subject, the evaluation receives less attention from researchers than the application. We conclude some limitations in existing studies about the evaluation of code generated by LLMs, like inadequate quality characteristics considered. And we think more effort is needed to narrow the gap between research on the evaluation and the application.},

  abstract = {Learning from small amounts of samples with reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging in many tasks, especially, in real-world applications, such as robotics. Meta-RL (meta-RL) has been proposed as an approach to address this problem by generalizing to new tasks through experience from previous similar tasks. However, these approaches generally perform meta-optimization by focusing direct policy search methods on validation samples from adapted policies, thus, requiring large amounts of on-policy samples during meta-training. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called supervised meta-RL with trajectory optimization (SMRL-TO) by integrating model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and iterative LQR (iLQR)-based trajectory optimization. Our approach is designed to provide online supervision for validation samples through iLQR-based trajectory optimization and embed simple imitation learning into the meta-optimization rather than policy gradient steps. This is actually a bi-level optimization that needs to calculate several gradient updates in each meta-iteration, consisting of off-policy RL in the inner loop and online imitation learning in the outer loop. SMRL-TO can achieve significant improvements in sample efficiency without human-provided demonstrations, due to the effective supervision from iLQR-based trajectory optimization. In this article, we describe how to use iLQR-based trajectory optimization to obtain labeled data and then how leverage them to assist the training of meta-learner. Through a series of robotic manipulation tasks, we further show that compared with the previous methods, the proposed approach can substantially improve sample efficiency and achieve better asymptotic performance.},

Due to the mechanical factors such as joint deformation and heavy load, some errors are non-geometrical and nonlinear. In this case, a single kinematic calibration method is difficult to achieve good results especially for robots with heavy load. In this paper, a two-stage parameter identification method is proposed, which also deals with joint deformation and heavy load dependent errors to achieve a higher positioning accuracy. In the first stage, the method builds the kinematic model and identifies the geometric errors using the DH model and the distance model. In the second stage, the stiffness of the joint is analyzed and the positioning accuracy is improved on the robot dynamics. Finally, the experiments are carried out on the 6R robot with heavy load. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the method.},

Weaver is pre-trained on a carefully selected corpus that focuses on improving the writing capabilities of large language models. We then fine-tune Weaver for creative and professional writing purposes and align it to the preference of professional writers using a suit of novel methods for instruction data synthesis and LLM alignment, making it able to produce more human-like texts and follow more diverse instructions for content creation. The Weaver family consists of models of Weaver Mini (1.8B), Weaver Base (6B), Weaver Pro (14B), and Weaver Ultra (34B) sizes, suitable for different applications and can be dynamically dispatched by a routing agent according to query complexity to balance response quality and computation cost. Evaluation on a carefully curated benchmark for assessing the writing capabilities of LLMs shows Weaver models of all sizes outperform generalist LLMs several times larger than them. Notably, our most-capable Weaver Ultra model surpasses GPT-4, a state-of-the-art generalist LLM, on various writing scenarios, demonstrating the advantage of training specialized LLMs for writing purposes. Moreover, Weaver natively supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and function calling (tool usage). We present various use cases of these abilities for improving AI-assisted writing systems, including integration of external knowledge bases, tools, or APIs, and providing personalized writing assistance. Furthermore, we discuss and summarize a guideline and best practices for pre-training and fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs.},

  abstract = {Till now, most calibration methods only compensate geometric error caused by inaccurate kinematic parameters, while the desired accuracy may still not be achieved when the robot is performing long-stroke, heavy-duty loading and unloading tasks. In this paper, a generalized semi-analytical beam deformation model is firstly proposed for the Cartesian robot to compensate the non-geometric error due to structural deformation under both distributed and concentrated loads. The adjustment factors are introduced in this model to deal with the over-constrained boundary conditions for both intermediate and side modules of the long-stroke Cartesian robot. This improves the fitness of the coming geometric error model, which assumes the beam to be rigid and straight. In addition, as the major error components which do not conform to the Gaussian distribution have been extracted in earlier steps, the Gaussian process regression model is imported to predict the residual error more accurately. In this way, comprehensive geometric and non-geometric error modeling and compensation procedures are formed for the multi-module, long-stroke Cartesian robot. Simulations and real-time experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The resulting 2D objects can be used for a first coarse 3D position estimate but for a precise location, additional sensor data has to be taken into account. For further use in sensor fusion systems and environment maps it is preferable to detect objects, their orientation and dimensions directly in 3D coordinates. To address this 3D object detection task, we propose a direct 3D bounding box estimator which is realized as CNN decoder module and can be connected to most 2D object detectors like SSD[1], OverFeat[2], YOLO[3] and RetinaNet[4] or directly to CNN feature extractors like VGG [2] and ResNet [5]. The 3D parameters of the objects such as dimension and orientation are directly predicted by the CNN module. To successfully train this complex MultiNet architecture, a combination and modification of current loss functions is proposed. The fastest of the proposed network module combinations is capable of detecting objects in 3D camera coordinates at a frame rate of 28 fps.},

Formal verification was then carried out by automatically translating this model to the input language of an existing model checker. Four sample properties based on system requirements were verified. We then refined the environment model three times to increase its accuracy and the persuasiveness of the formal verification results. The first refinement uses a user activity log based on real-life experiments, but is deterministic. The second refinement uses the activities from the user activity log nondeterministically. The third refinement uses ``conjoined activities'' based on an observation that many user activities can overlap. The four samples properties were verified for each refinement of the environment model. Finally, we discuss the approach of environment model refinement with respect to this case study.},

The results show participants using the block-based interface successfully implemented robot programs faster with no loss in accuracy while reporting higher scores for usability, learnability, and overall satisfaction.

Errors leading to damage and stop of production are extremely expensive and must be avoided by all means. Hence, the state of practice is to test control programs in advance which implies high effort and comes with high costs. To increase the confidence into the control systems and to reduce the necessary effort, this paper proposes to use model checking to verify certain properties. It presents a compiler that can transform industrial robot programs into PROMELA models. Since the statements of the robot programming language can not be mapped directly into PROMELA statements, we apply compiler optimization techniques to close the semantic gap. In case of a specification violation the trace is mapped to the original context so that the robot programmer can reconstruct the problem. As a case study we applied the tool to verify the absence of collisions and deadlocks. We were able to detect one deadlock in a car-body welding station with 9 robots, correct the program and verify the correctness of the resulting system.},

A Bayesian Network encodes the dependencies between this information provided by the user. The output of this model generates a ranked list of grasp poses best suitable for a given task which is then passed to the motion planner. Our system was implemented in ROS and tested on a PR2 robot. We compared the system to state-of-the-art implementations using quantitative (e.g. success rate, execution times) as well as qualitative (e.g. user convenience, cognitive load) metrics.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new gesture-based human interface for natural robot control. Detailed activity of the user's hand and arm is acquired via a novel device, called the BioSleeve, which packages dry-contact surface electromyography (EMG) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) into a sleeve worn on the forearm. The BioSleeve's accompanying algorithms can reliably decode as many as sixteen discrete hand gestures and estimate the continuous orientation of the forearm. These gestures and positions are mapped to robot commands that, to varying degrees, integrate with the robot's perception of its environment and its ability to complete tasks autonomously. This flexible approach enables, for example, supervisory point-to-goal commands, virtual joystick for guarded teleoperation, and high degree of freedom mimicked manipulation, all from a single device. The BioSleeve is meant for portable field use; unlike other gesture recognition systems, use of the BioSleeve for robot control is invariant to lighting conditions, occlusions, and the human-robot spatial relationship and does not encumber the user's hands. The BioSleeve control approach has been implemented on three robot types, and we present proof-of-principle demonstrations with mobile ground robots, manipulation robots, and prosthetic hands.},

  abstract = {Language model alignment has become an important component of AI safety, allowing safe interactions between humans and language models, by enhancing desired behaviors and inhibiting undesired ones. It is often done by tuning the model or inserting preset aligning prompts. Recently, representation engineering, a method which alters the model's behavior via changing its representations post-training, was shown to be effective in aligning LLMs (Zou et al., 2023a). Representation engineering yields gains in alignment oriented tasks such as resistance to adversarial attacks and reduction of social biases, but was also shown to cause a decrease in the ability of the model to perform basic tasks. In this paper we study the tradeoff between the increase in alignment and decrease in helpfulness of the model. We propose a theoretical framework which provides bounds for these two quantities, and demonstrate their relevance empirically. Interestingly, we find that while the helpfulness generally decreases, it does so quadratically with the norm of the representation engineering vector, while the alignment increases linearly with it, indicating a regime in which it is efficient to use representation engineering. We validate our findings empirically, and chart the boundaries to the usefulness of representation engineering for alignment.},

Existing methods rely on explicit supervision to establish multi-view correspondences, such as template shape models and keypoint annotations, which restricts their applicability on objects ``in the wild''. A more natural way of establishing correspondences is by watching videos of objects moving around. In this paper, we present DOVE, a method that learns textured 3D models of deformable object categories from monocular videos available online, without keypoint, viewpoint or template shape supervision. By resolving symmetry-induced pose ambiguities and leveraging temporal correspondences in videos, the model automatically learns to factor out 3D shape, articulated pose and texture from each individual RGB frame, and is ready for single-image inference at test time. In the experiments, we show that existing methods fail to learn sensible 3D shapes without additional keypoint or template supervision, whereas our method produces temporally consistent 3D models, which can be animated and rendered from arbitrary viewpoints.

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of learning a repertoire of low-level skills from raw images that can be sequenced to complete long-horizon visuomotor tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for acquiring short-horizon skills autonomously. However, the focus of RL algorithms has largely been on the success of those individual skills, more so than learning and grounding a large repertoire of skills that can be sequenced to complete extended multi-stage tasks. The latter demands robustness and persistence, as errors in skills can compound over time, and may require the robot to have a number of primitive skills in its repertoire, rather than just one. To this end, we introduce EMBR, a model-based RL method for learning primitive skills that are suitable for completing long-horizon visuomotor tasks. EMBR learns and plans using a learned model, critic, and success classifier, where the success classifier serves both as a reward function for RL and as a grounding mechanism to continuously detect if the robot should retry a skill when unsuccessful or under perturbations. Further, the learned model is task-agnostic and trained using data from all skills, enabling the robot to efficiently learn a number of distinct primitives. These visuomotor primitive skills and their associated pre- and post-conditions can then be directly combined with off-the-shelf symbolic planners to complete long-horizon tasks. On a Franka Emika robot arm, we find that EMBR enables the robot to complete three long-horizon visuomotor tasks at 85\% success rate, such as organizing an office desk, a file cabinet, and drawers, which require sequencing up to 12 skills, involve 14 unique learned primitives, and demand generalization to novel objects.},

In this research, we apply a Systems Engineering lens to investigate the use of V-Model in addressing the interdisciplinary collaboration challenges when building ML-enabled systems. By interviewing practitioners from software companies, we established a set of 8 propositions for using V-Model to manage interdisciplinary collaborations when building products with ML components. Based on the propositions, we found that despite requiring additional efforts, the characteristics of V-Model align effectively with several collaboration challenges encountered by practitioners when building ML-enabled systems. We recommend future research to investigate new process models that leverage the characteristics of V-Model such as the system decomposition, clear system boundary, and consistency of Validation \&amp; Verification (V\&amp;V) for building ML-enabled systems.},

Moreover, the proposed gradient normalization can be applied to different GAN architectures with little modification.

  abstract = {Projecting high-dimensional environment observations into lower-dimensional structured representations can considerably improve data-efficiency for reinforcement learning in domains with limited data such as robotics. Can a single generally useful representation be found? In order to answer this question, it is important to understand how the representation will be used by the agent and what properties such a 'good' representation should have. In this paper we systematically evaluate a number of common learnt and hand-engineered representations in the context of three robotics tasks: lifting, stacking and pushing of 3D blocks. The representations are evaluated in two use-cases: as input to the agent, or as a source of auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, the value of each representation is evaluated in terms of three properties: dimensionality, observability and disentanglement. We can significantly improve performance in both use-cases and demonstrate that some representations can perform commensurate to simulator states as agent inputs. Finally, our results challenge common intuitions by demonstrating that: 1) dimensionality strongly matters for task generation, but is negligible for inputs, 2) observability of task-relevant aspects mostly affects the input representation use-case, and 3) disentanglement leads to better auxiliary tasks, but has only limited benefits for input representations. This work serves as a step towards a more systematic understanding of what makes a 'good' representation for control in robotics, enabling practitioners to make more informed choices for developing new learned or hand-engineered representations.},

The DT model of the robotic arm is first established, including the physical layer, data transfer layer, model layer, functional layer, and application service layer. A low-cost attitude sensor is then applied to provide actual information of the robotic arm to the DT model. When the DT model senses the positioning error of the robotic arm, it reduces the positioning error by adjusting the motor angle. The effectiveness of the proposed method is finally verified by the experimental results under different conditions.},

To address these drawbacks we propose a method that combines reinforcement and imitation learning by shaping the reward function with a state-and-action-dependent potential that is trained from demonstration data, using a generative model. We show that this accelerates policy learning by specifying high-value areas of the state and action space that are worth exploring first. Unlike the majority of existing methods that assume optimal demonstrations and incorporate the demonstration data as hard constraints on policy optimization, we instead incorporate demonstration data as advice in the form of a reward shaping potential trained as a generative model of states and actions. In particular, we examine both normalizing flows and Generative Adversarial Networks to represent these potentials. We show that, unlike many existing approaches that incorporate demonstrations as hard constraints, our approach is unbiased even in the case of suboptimal and noisy demonstrations. We present an extensive range of simulations, as well as experiments on the Franka Emika 7DOF arm, to demonstrate the practicality of our method.},

In this work, we investigate personalization of household cleanup with robots that can tidy up rooms by picking up objects and putting them away. A key challenge is determining the proper place to put each object, as people's preferences can vary greatly depending on personal taste or cultural background. For instance, one person may prefer storing shirts in the drawer, while another may prefer them on the shelf. We aim to build systems that can learn such preferences from just a handful of examples via prior interactions with a particular person. We show that robots can combine language-based planning and perception with the few-shot summarization capabilities of large language models to infer generalized user preferences that are broadly applicable to future interactions. This approach enables fast adaptation and achieves 91.2\% accuracy on unseen objects in our benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate our approach on a real-world mobile manipulator called TidyBot, which successfully puts away 85.0\% of objects in real-world test scenarios.},

  abstract = {Temporal recommendation methods can achieve superior accuracy due to updating user/item embeddings continuously once obtaining new interactions. However, the randomness of user behaviors will introduce noises into the user interactions and cause the deviation in the modeling of user preference, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose NeuFilter, a robust temporal recommendation algorithm based on neural Kalman Filtering, to learn more accurate user and item embeddings with noisy interactions. Classic Kalman Filtering is time-consuming when applied to recommendation due to its covariance matrices. Thus, we propose a neural network solution to Kalman Filtering, so as to realize higher efficiency and stronger expressivity. Specifically, NeuFilter consists of three alternating units: 1) prediction unit, which predicts user and item embeddings based on their historical embeddings; 2) estimation unit, which updates user and item embeddings in a manner similar to Kalman Filtering; 3) correction unit, which corrects the updated user and item embeddings from estimation unit to ensure reliable estimation and accurate update. Experiments on two recommendation tasks show that NeuFilter can achieve higher accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods, while achieving high robustness. Moreover, our empirical studies on a node classification task further confirm the importance of handling noises in tasks on temporal graph, shedding a new light on temporal graph modeling.},

The problem is challenging due to the variety of objects as well as the complexity of a scene caused by clutter and occlusions between objects. In this work, we introduce PoseCNN, a new Convolutional Neural Network for 6D object pose estimation. PoseCNN estimates the 3D translation of an object by localizing its center in the image and predicting its distance from the camera. The 3D rotation of the object is estimated by regressing to a quaternion representation. We also introduce a novel loss function that enables PoseCNN to handle symmetric objects. In addition, we contribute a large scale video dataset for 6D object pose estimation named the YCB-Video dataset. Our dataset provides accurate 6D poses of 21 objects from the YCB dataset observed in 92 videos with 133,827 frames. We conduct extensive experiments on our YCB-Video dataset and the OccludedLINEMOD dataset to show that PoseCNN is highly robust to occlusions, can handle symmetric objects, and provide accurate pose estimation using only color images as input. When using depth data to further refine the poses, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging OccludedLINEMOD dataset. Our code and dataset are available at https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/.},

  abstract = {Inferring the complete 3D shape of an object from an RGB image has shown impressive results, however, existing methods rely primarily on recognizing the most similar 3D model from the training set to solve the problem. These methods suffer from poor generalization and may lead to low-quality reconstructions for unseen objects. Nowadays, stereo cameras are pervasive in emerging devices such as dual-lens smartphones and robots, which enables the use of the two-view nature of stereo images to explore the 3D structure and thus improve the reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for reconstructing the 3D shape of an object from a pair of stereo images, which reasons about the 3D structure of the object by taking bidirectional disparities and feature correspondences between the two views into account. Besides, we present a large-scale synthetic benchmarking dataset, namely StereoShapeNet, containing 1,052,976 pairs of stereo images rendered from ShapeNet along with the corresponding bidirectional depth and disparity maps. Experimental results on the StereoShapeNet benchmark demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning and planning methods require an objective or reward function that encodes the desired behavior. Yet, in practice, there is a wide range of scenarios where an objective is difficult to provide programmatically, such as tasks with visual observations involving unknown object positions or deformable objects. In these cases, prior methods use engineered problem-specific solutions, e.g., by instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to measure a proxy for the objective. Such solutions require a significant engineering effort on a per-task basis, and make it impractical for robots to continuously learn complex skills outside of laboratory settings. We aim to find a more general and scalable solution for specifying goals for robot learning in unconstrained environments. To that end, we formulate the few-shot objective learning problem, where the goal is to learn a task objective from only a few example images of successful end states for that task. We propose a simple solution to this problem: meta-learn a classifier that can recognize new goals from a few examples. We show how this approach can be used with both model-free reinforcement learning and visual model-based planning and show results in three domains: rope manipulation from images in simulation, visual navigation in a simulated 3D environment, and object arrangement into user-specified configurations on a real robot.},

Although numerical methods based on inverse differential kinematics are efficient in solving the inverse kinematics problem of seven-degree-of-freedom robots with arbitrary geometric parameters, they are deficient in numerical stability and time-consuming for convergence to one solution governed by the initial guess.

  abstract = {Despite its success, deep learning still needs large labeled datasets to succeed. Data augmentation has shown much promise in alleviating the need for more labeled data, but it so far has mostly been applied in supervised settings and achieved limited gains. In this work, we propose to apply data augmentation to unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning setting. Our method, named Unsupervised Data Augmentation or UDA, encourages the model predictions to be consistent between an unlabeled example and an augmented unlabeled example. Unlike previous methods that use random noise such as Gaussian noise or dropout noise, UDA has a small twist in that it makes use of harder and more realistic noise generated by state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. This small twist leads to substantial improvements on six language tasks and three vision tasks even when the labeled set is extremely small. For example, on the IMDb text classification dataset, with only 20 labeled examples, UDA outperforms the state-of-the-art model trained on 25,000 labeled examples. On standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, CIFAR-10 with 4,000 examples and SVHN with 1,000 examples, UDA outperforms all previous approaches and reduces more than 30\% of the error rates of state-of-the-art methods: going from 7.66\% to 5.27\% and from 3.53\% to 2.46\% respectively. UDA also works well on datasets that have a lot of labeled data. For example, on ImageNet, with 1.3M extra unlabeled data, UDA improves the top-1/top-5 accuracy from 78.28/94.36\% to 79.04/94.45\% when compared to AutoAugment.},

However, they suffer from sufficient nonlinearities and model uncertainties due to friction, tension varying, tendon slacking, etc. Model based control is insufficient to overcome such uncertainties and automate challenging surgical related tasks. The objective of this work is to automate certain clinical tasks to alleviate surgeon fatigue and promote task efficiency in kinematics free and sensor free circumstances. We present a data-driven approach based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which utilizes statistical machine learning models to encode system underlying dynamics and generalize smooth motor trajectories by direct actuation space learning. Motion segmentation is enabled with soft margin Support Vector Machine (soft-SVM) in complicated tasks. We also make attempts to retrieve task-specific properties by Locally Weighted Regression (LWR). We evaluated the approach on two surgical related tasks: compliant insertion and simplified Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). The flexible TSM successfully reproduced both tasks and demonstrated superior trajectory performance. A video is available at: https://youtu.be/rLQo6xKtyMI.},

  abstract = {Foundation models have emerged as a powerful tool for many AI problems. Despite the tremendous success of foundation models, effective adaptation to new tasks, particularly those with limited labels, remains an open question and lacks theoretical understanding. An emerging solution with recent success in vision and NLP involves finetuning a foundation model on a selection of relevant tasks, before its adaptation to a target task with limited labeled samples. In this paper, we study the theoretical justification of this multitask finetuning approach. Our theoretical analysis reveals that with a diverse set of related tasks, this multitask finetuning leads to reduced error in the target task, in comparison to directly adapting the same pretrained model. We quantify the relationship between finetuning tasks and target tasks by diversity and consistency metrics, and further propose a practical task selection algorithm. We substantiate our theoretical claims with extensive empirical evidence. Further, we present results affirming our task selection algorithm adeptly chooses related finetuning tasks, providing advantages to the model performance on target tasks. We believe our study shed new light on the effective adaptation of foundation models to new tasks that lack abundant labels.

These specifications are fed to a hierarchical neural program, where bottom-level programs are callable subroutines that interact with the environment.

The experimental results show that NTP learns to generalize well towards unseen tasks with increasing lengths, variable topologies, and changing objectives.stanfordvl.github.io/ntp/.},

Previous works solve a differential Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system for the trajectory derivative, and achieve this efficiently by solving an auxiliary Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem. In contrast, we directly evaluate the matrix equations which arise from applying variable elimination on the Lagrange multiplier terms in the (differential) KKT system. By appropriately accounting for the structure of the terms within the resulting equations, we show that the trajectory derivatives scale linearly with the number of timesteps. Furthermore, our approach allows for easy parallelization, significantly improved scalability with model size, direct computation of vector-Jacobian products and improved numerical stability compared to prior works. As an additional contribution, we unify prior works, addressing claims that computing trajectory derivatives using IFT scales quadratically with the number of timesteps. We evaluate our method on a both synthetic benchmark and four challenging, learning from demonstration benchmarks including a 6-DoF maneuvering quadrotor and 6-DoF rocket powered landing.},

In contrast, motion planners use explicit models of the agent and environment to plan collision-free paths to faraway goals, but suffer from inaccurate models in tasks that require contacts with the environment. To combine the benefits of both approaches, we propose motion planner augmented RL (MoPA-RL) which augments the action space of an RL agent with the long-horizon planning capabilities of motion planners. Based on the magnitude of the action, our approach smoothly transitions between directly executing the action and invoking a motion planner. We evaluate our approach on various simulated manipulation tasks and compare it to alternative action spaces in terms of learning efficiency and safety. The experiments demonstrate that MoPA-RL increases learning efficiency, leads to a faster exploration, and results in safer policies that avoid collisions with the environment.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) promises data-driven insights and solutions for people from all walks of life, but the skill of crafting these solutions is possessed by only a few. Emerging research addresses this issue by creating ML tools that are easy and accessible to people who are not formally trained in ML (non-experts). This work investigated how non-experts build ML solutions for themselves in real life. Our interviews and surveys revealed unique potentials of non-expert ML, as well several pitfalls that non-experts are susceptible to. For example, many perceived percentage accuracy as a sole measure of performance, thus problematic models proceeded to deployment. These observations suggested that, while challenging, making ML easy and robust should both be important goals of designing novice-facing ML tools. To advance on this insight, we discuss design implications and created a sensitizing concept to demonstrate how designers might guide non-experts to easily build robust solutions.},

  abstract = {The Kalman filter has been adopted in acoustic echo cancellation due to its robustness to double-talk, fast convergence, and good steady-state performance. The performance of Kalman filter is closely related to the estimation accuracy of the state noise covariance and the observation noise covariance. The estimation error may lead to unacceptable results, especially when the echo path suffers abrupt changes, the tracking performance of the Kalman filter could be degraded significantly. In this paper, we propose the neural Kalman filtering (NKF), which uses neural networks to implicitly model the covariance of the state noise and observation noise and to output the Kalman gain in real-time. Experimental results on both synthetic test sets and real-recorded test sets show that, the proposed NKF has superior convergence and re-convergence performance while ensuring low near-end speech degradation compared with the state-of-the-art model-based methods. Moreover, the model size of the proposed NKF is merely 5.3 K and the RTF is as low as 0.09, which indicates that it can be deployed in low-resource platforms.},

Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.},

The impact of parameter errors upon the static pose error of the uncoupling manipulator is analysed. The flexibility of the robot's key components is taken into consideration to analyse its impact on the position and orientation error of the manipulator. The position and orientation error compensation is developed by using input motion planning method to improve the pose accuracy of the robot. Additional motions are added to each joint of the robot such that the uncoupling manipulator can generate a corresponding tiny perturbation, which is used to eliminate the positioning error, ensuring the uncoupling action is completed successfully.},

We evaluate our model on QA benchmarks in the commonsense (CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA) and biomedical (MedQA-USMLE) domains.

We propose a novel deep neural networks (DNN) based model, Canonical Correlated AutoEncoder (C2AE), for solving this task. Aiming at better relating feature and label domain data for improved classification, we uniquely perform joint feature and label embedding by deriving a deep latent space, followed by the introduction of label-correlation sensitive loss function for recovering the predicted label outputs. Our C2AE is achieved by integrating the DNN architectures of canonical correlation analysis and autoencoder, which allows end-to-end learning and prediction with the ability to exploit label dependency. Moreover, our C2AE can be easily extended to address the learning problem with missing labels. Our experiments on multiple datasets with different scales confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method, which is shown to perform favorably against state-of-the-art methods for multi-label classification.}

We study this problem under the framework of transfer learning, where the model is first trained on a passive vision task (i.e., the data distribution does not depend on the agent's decisions), then adapted to perform an active manipulation task (i.e., the data distribution does depend on the agent's decisions). We find that pre-training on vision tasks significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency for learning to manipulate objects. However, realizing these gains requires careful selection of which parts of the model to transfer. Our key insight is that outputs of standard vision models highly correlate with affordance maps commonly used in manipulation. Therefore, we explore directly transferring model parameters from vision networks to affordance prediction networks, and show that this can result in successful zero-shot adaptation, where a robot can pick up certain objects with zero robotic experience. With just a small amount of robotic experience, we can further fine-tune the affordance model to achieve better results. With just 10 minutes of suction experience or 1 hour of grasping experience, our method achieves 80\% success rate at picking up novel objects.},

  abstract = {The ability to learn new concepts with small amounts of data is a critical aspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult. Our approach substantially outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in these settings.},

Neural A* solves a path planning problem by encoding a problem instance to a guidance map and then performing the differentiable A* search with the guidance map. By learning to match the search results with ground-truth paths provided by experts, Neural A* can produce a path consistent with the ground truth accurately and efficiently. Our extensive experiments confirmed that Neural A* outperformed state-of-the-art data-driven planners in terms of the search optimality and efficiency trade-off.

One solution to this is active learning, where a model asks human to annotate data that it perceived as uncertain. A variety of recent methods have been proposed to apply active learning to deep networks but most of them are either designed specific for their target tasks or computationally inefficient for large networks. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method that is simple but task-agnostic, and works efficiently with the deep networks. We attach a small parametric module, named "loss prediction module," to a target network, and learn it to predict target losses of unlabeled inputs. Then, this module can suggest data that the target model is likely to produce a wrong prediction. This method is task-agnostic as networks are learned from a single loss regardless of target tasks. We rigorously validate our method through image classification, object detection, and human pose estimation, with the recent network architectures. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the previous methods over the tasks.},

  abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.}

  abstract = {Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new skills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn. However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the full potential of these methods.},

Compared with conventional pre-trained generation models, RAG methods have remarkable advantages such as easy knowledge acquisition, strong scalability, and low training cost. Although existing RAG models have been applied to various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, such as open-domain QA and dialogue systems, most of the work has focused on retrieving unstructured text documents from Wikipedia. In this paper, I first elaborate on the current obstacles to retrieving knowledge from a single-source homogeneous corpus. Then, I demonstrate evidence from both existing literature and my experiments, and provide multiple solutions on retrieval-augmented generation methods across heterogeneous knowledge.},

  abstract = {The goal of text-to-text generation is to make machines express like a human in many applications such as conversation, summarization, and translation. It is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Various neural encoder-decoder models have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, researchers have considered incorporating (i) internal knowledge embedded in the input text and (ii) external knowledge from outside sources such as knowledge base and knowledge graph into the text generation system. This research topic is known as knowledge-enhanced text generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the research on this topic over the past five years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and architectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data. This survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in academia and industry.},

On the other hand, symbolic systems exhibit exceptional cognitive intelligence but suffer from poor learning capabilities when compared to neural systems. Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies, an ideal solution emerges: combining neural systems and symbolic systems to create neural-symbolic learning systems that possess powerful perception and cognition. The purpose of this paper is to survey the advancements in neural-symbolic learning systems from four distinct perspectives: challenges, methods, applications, and future directions. By doing so, this research aims to propel this emerging field forward, offering researchers a comprehensive and holistic overview.

Since classic methods rely heavily on object pose estimation, they often struggle to generalize to new objects without 3D CAD models or task-specific training data. In this work, we propose to formulate the kit assembly task as a shape matching problem, where the goal is to learn a shape descriptor that establishes geometric correspondences between object surfaces and their target placement locations from visual input. This formulation enables the model to acquire a broader understanding of how shapes and surfaces fit together for assembly -- allowing it to generalize to new objects and kits. To obtain training data for our model, we present a self-supervised data-collection pipeline that obtains ground truth object-to-placement correspondences by disassembling complete kits. Our resulting real-world system, Form2Fit, learns effective pick and place strategies for assembling objects into a variety of kits -- achieving \$90{\textbackslash}\%\$ average success rates under different initial conditions (e.g. varying object and kit poses), \$94{\textbackslash}\%\$ success under new configurations of multiple kits, and over \$86{\textbackslash}\%\$ success with completely new objects and kits.},

Understanding and assessing this intelligence is a complex task. Amidst the swift progress and extensive proliferation of large language models (LLMs), their applications in the field of robotics have garnered increasing attention. LLMs possess the ability to process and generate natural language, facilitating efficient interaction and collaboration with robots. Researchers and engineers in the field of robotics have recognized the immense potential of LLMs in enhancing robot intelligence, human-robot interaction, and autonomy. Therefore, this comprehensive review aims to summarize the applications of LLMs in robotics, delving into their impact and contributions to key areas such as robot control, perception, decision-making, and path planning. We first provide an overview of the background and development of LLMs for robotics, followed by a description of the benefits of LLMs for robotics and recent advancements in robotics models based on LLMs. We then delve into the various techniques used in the model, including those employed in perception, decision-making, control, and interaction. Finally, we explore the applications of LLMs in robotics and some potential challenges they may face in the near future. Embodied intelligence is the future of intelligent science, and LLMs-based robotics is one of the promising but challenging paths to achieve this.},

We still, though, do not yet have a clear understanding of how the choice of pretraining objective affects the type of linguistic information that models learn.

However, crafting good human models is challenging; capturing context-dependent human behavior requires significant prior knowledge and/or large amounts of interaction data, both of which are difficult to obtain. In this work, we explore the potential of large-language models (LLMs) -- which have consumed vast amounts of human-generated text data -- to act as zero-shot human models for HRI. Our experiments on three social datasets yield promising results; the LLMs are able to achieve performance comparable to purpose-built models. That said, we also discuss current limitations, such as sensitivity to prompts and spatial/numerical reasoning mishaps. Based on our findings, we demonstrate how LLM-based human models can be integrated into a social robot's planning process and applied in HRI scenarios. Specifically, we present one case study on a simulated trust-based table-clearing task and replicate past results that relied on custom models. Next, we conduct a new robot utensil-passing experiment (n = 65) where preliminary results show that planning with a LLM-based human model can achieve gains over a basic myopic plan. In summary, our results show that LLMs offer a promising (but incomplete) approach to human modeling for HRI.},

A desirable capability of these agents is to respond to goal-oriented commands by autonomously constructing task plans. However, such autonomy can add significant cognitive load and potentially introduce safety risks to humans when agents behave in unexpected ways. Hence, for such agents to be helpful, one important requirement is for them to synthesize plans that can be easily understood by humans. While there exists previous work that studied socially acceptable robots that interact with humans in ``natural ways'', and work that investigated legible motion planning, there is no general solution for high level task planning. To address this issue, we introduce the notions of plan explicability and predictability. To compute these measures, first, we postulate that humans understand agent plans by associating abstract tasks with agent actions, which can be considered as a labeling process. We learn the labeling scheme of humans for agent plans from training examples using conditional random fields (CRFs). Then, we use the learned model to label a new plan to compute its explicability and predictability. These measures can be used by agents to proactively choose or directly synthesize plans that are more explicable and predictable to humans. We provide evaluations on a synthetic domain and with a physical robot to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Industrial automation applications often need to transmit time- and safety-critical data to closely monitor and control industrial processes. Several Ethernet-based fieldbus solutions, such as PROFINET IRT, EtherNet/IP, and EtherCAT, are widely used to ensure real-time communications in industrial automation systems. These solutions, however, commonly incorporate additional mechanisms to provide latency guarantees, making their interoperability a grand challenge.

These solutions can be evolved and adapted for cross-industry scenarios, such as large-scale distributed industrial plants requiring multiple industrial entities to work collaboratively. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current advances in TSN standards for industrial automation. It presents the state-of-the-art IEEE TSN standards and discusses the opportunities and challenges of integrating TSN into the automation industry. Some promising research directions are also highlighted for applying TSN technologies to industrial automation applications.},

Unlike the previous 3D generative model for point cloud, voxel, and implicit surface, volumetric mesh is a ready-to-use representation in industry with details on both the surface and interior. Generating this kind of highly-structured data thus brings a great challenge. To tackle this problem, we first propose to use a diffusion-based generative model to generate voxelized shapes with realistic shape and topology information. With the voxelized shape, we can simply obtain a tetrahedral mesh as a template. Further, we use a voxel-conditional neural network to predict the surface conditioned on the voxels, and progressively project the tetrahedral mesh to the predicted surface under regularization. As shown in the experiments, without any post-processing, our pipeline can generate high-quality artifact-free volumetric and surface meshes.},

  abstract = {Assessing foundation models' abilities for human-level tasks is crucial for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development.Traditional benchmarks, which rely on artificial datasets, may not accurately represent these capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AGIEval, a novel bilingual benchmark designed to assess foundation models in the context of human-centric standardized exams, such as college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions, and lawyer qualification tests. We evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation models on our benchmark. Impressively, we show that GPT-4 exceeds the average human performance in SAT, LSAT, and math contests, with 95\% accuracy on SAT Math and 92.5\% on the Chinese college entrance English exam. This demonstrates the exceptional performance of contemporary foundation models. In contrast, we also find that GPT-4 is less proficient in tasks requiring complex reasoning or specific domain knowledge. Our comprehensive analyses of model capabilities (understanding, knowledge, reasoning, and calculation) reveal their strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into future directions for enhancing general capabilities. By concentrating on tasks pertinent to human cognition and decision-making, our benchmark delivers a meaningful and robust evaluation of foundation models' performance in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract = {Movement Primitives (MPs) are a promising way for representing robot motions in a flexible and adaptable manner. Due to the simple and compact form, they have been widely used in robotics. A major goal of the research activities on MPs is to learn models, which can adapt to changing task constraints, e. g. new motion targets. However, the adaptability of current MPs is limited to a small set of constraints due to their simple structures. It is indeed not a trivial task to maintain the simplicity of MPs representation and, at the same time, enhance their adaptability. In this paper, we discuss the adaptability of popular MPs such as Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) and Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMP) and propose a new simple but efficient formulation of MPs, the Via-points Movement Primitive (VMP), that can adapt to arbitrary via-points using a simple structured model that is based on the previous approaches but outperforms those in terms of extrapolation abilities.},

  abstract = {Representing robot skills as movement primitives that can be learned from human demonstration and adapted to new tasks and situations is a promising approach towards intuitive robot programming. To allow such adaptation, a mapping between task parameters and movement primitives parameters is needed, and different approaches have been proposed in the literature to learn such a mapping. In human demonstrations, however, multiple modes and models exist, which should be taken into account when learning these mappings and generalized movement primitive representations. Here, a challenging problem is mode or model collapse. In order to solve this problem, we propose using a Mixture Density Network (MDN) that takes task parameters as input and provides a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of the movement primitive parameters. To avoid mode and model collapse during MDN training, we introduce an entropy cost to achieve a more balanced association of demonstrations to GMM mixture components. Since it is often easier to collect failed examples by using an underfitted MDN model instead of additional human demonstrations, we introduce a failure cost to reduce the occurrence of failures in future executions. We evaluated our approach in simulation and real robot experiments and showed that the method outperforms previous approaches.},

In this work, we present a densely annotated dataset ADE20K, which spans diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts. Totally there are 25k images of the complex everyday scenes containing a variety of objects in their natural spatial context. On average there are 19.5 instances and 10.5 object classes per image. Based on ADE20K, we construct benchmarks for scene parsing and instance segmentation. We provide baseline performances on both of the benchmarks and re-implement state-of-the-art models for open source. We further evaluate the effect of synchronized batch normalization and find that a reasonably large batch size is crucial for the semantic segmentation performance. We show that the networks trained on ADE20K are able to segment a wide variety of scenes and objects.},

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target-domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

Most work on reward learning has used simulated environments, but complex information about values is often expressed in natural language, and we believe reward learning for language is a key to making RL practical and safe for real-world tasks. In this paper, we build on advances in generative pretraining of language models to apply reward learning to four natural language tasks: continuing text with positive sentiment or physically descriptive language, and summarization tasks on the TL;DR and CNN/Daily Mail datasets. For stylistic continuation we achieve good results with only 5,000 comparisons evaluated by humans. For summarization, models trained with 60,000 comparisons copy whole sentences from the input but skip irrelevant preamble; this leads to reasonable ROUGE scores and very good performance according to our human labelers, but may be exploiting the fact that labelers rely on simple heuristics.},

  abstract = {We study how vision-language models trained on Internet-scale data can be incorporated directly into end-to-end robotic control to boost generalization and enable emergent semantic reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object). We further show that incorporating chain of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to pick up for use as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best suited for someone who is tired (an energy drink).},

Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.},
