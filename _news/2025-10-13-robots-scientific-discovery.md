Our paper “Open, Reproducible and Trustworthy Robot-Based Experiments with Virtual Labs and Digital-Twin-Based Execution Tracing” ([<i class="fas fa-link"></i>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11406), [<i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i>](/assets/vrb_scientific_discovery_IROS25_AIR4S.pdf)) has been accepted to the [AIR4S Workshop](https://airobot4sci.github.io/) at IROS 2025.
In this work, we introduce the RobAuditor semantic execution tracing framework and the [AICOR Virtual Research Building](https://vrb.ease-crc.org/), a cloud platform that enables transparent, reproducible, and shareable robot experiments. Together, these tools advance the vision of open, robot-driven science by combining deterministic execution, semantic memory, and digital-twin technologies for verifiable autonomous experimentation with robots.
