In my research, I teach industrial robots how to reason about their tasks, generate their own programs and optimize and refine them as they gain more experience - and how to deploy advanced AI models to solve real-world engineering problems. I lead the corporate research lab at ArtiMinds, collaborating with academic and industrial partners to bring about a future in which humans can intuitively program robots and ensure that their behavior is both task-oriented and safe.

My areas of interest include robot self-learning, unsupervised and meta-learning, differentiable programming, mechanistic interpretability and AI safety.
