I am interested in developing advanced cognitive architectures to solve real-world engineering problems with robots. As Technical Director of the [AICOR Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.uni-bremen.de/) at the University of Bremen, my team and I collaborate with academic and industrial partners to bring about a future in which humans can intuitively program robots and ensure that their behavior is both task-oriented and safe.

My areas of interest include robot self-learning, unsupervised and meta-learning, differentiable programming, mechanistic interpretability and AI safety.
