At this year’s IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2025), I had the privilege of presenting our work on the [AICOR Virtual Research Building (VRB)](https://vrb.ease-crc.org/) - a digital infrastructure initiative aimed at redefining how we conduct and disseminate robotics research and education in the cloud.

You can find my slides [here](https://nc.uni-bremen.de/index.php/s/ZEpMQDeNSHmcpRe).

# Democratizing Access to Robotics Research

The VRB is designed as an open, collaborative platform supporting a global research ecosystem. Our mission is threefold:

* Foster a globally connected robotics research community

* Make high-quality robotics education accessible and inclusive

* Accelerate open science and reproducibility in robotics

At its core, the VRB hosts shared research infrastructure such as [OpenEASE](https://www.open-ease.org/), a data repository that supports reproducible workflows and automated knowledge extraction.

# Robotics Education in the Cloud

The platform also includes a suite of educational tools:

* Interactive modules and AI-driven tutoring systems

* Virtual laboratories enabling hands-on learning for students with limited physical access

* A collaborative, open-source textbook framework designed to grow with the community

Through initiatives like the EASE Fall School and student competitions, we’re engaging learners with real-world projects and skill-building opportunities.

# Software Infrastructure for Scalable Research

The backbone of the VRB is a modular open-source software stack for cognitive robotics developed at the [IAI](https://ai.uni-bremen.de/) at University of Bremen:

* [Multiverse](https://github.com/Multiverse-Framework/Multiverse): a unified simulation backend based on USD, enabling interoperability across simulators

* [PyCRAM](https://github.com/cram2/pycram): a general-purpose plan executive supporting multiple robots and task domains

* [Giskard](https://github.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy), [RoboKudo](https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/robokudo/robokudo), and [KnowRob](https://github.com/knowrob/knowrob): motion planning, perception, and reasoning engines

* [CRAM Cognitive Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14119): enabling complex robot behavior grounded in cognitive principles

This modular architecture supports rapid prototyping, reproducibility, and collaborative development at scale.

# Join Us!

We invite universities, research institutions, and educators worldwide to become active contributors to the AICOR Virtual Research Building. By joining our community, you support a shared vision of open, reproducible science and equitable access to robotics education. Whether through sharing datasets, integrating educational content, or collaborating on cognitive architecture development, your participation helps build a sustainable, interoperable infrastructure for global research.

We will be presenting the VRB at ROSCon UK in Edinburgh (September 15-17), and are always looking for new use cases and partners.

Contact us at [https://vrb.ease-crc.org/contact](https://vrb.ease-crc.org/contact) to become part of the community!
